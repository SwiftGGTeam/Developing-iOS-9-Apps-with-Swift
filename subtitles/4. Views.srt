Stanford University. Okay,

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:11,910
well welcome to Lecture four of Stanford's CS193P,

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:16,682
spring of 2016. Today our topic is views. Okay,

5
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,485
views are the rectangular areas on screen that we draw

6
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,821
in. Its also the places where we handle multi-touch,

7
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,392
we'll be talking about that next week. So today is,

8
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,560
it's all about the drawing side and I have, of course,

9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,765
have a demo where we're gonna draw a custom view, okay? So

10
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:35,634
let's talk about views. The view is that rectangular area,

11
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,104
as I said. It defines a coordinate space, okay?

12
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,041
So, any time you're drawing or handling input, or whatever,

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,010
you need a coordinate space to be defined for you. And,

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:49,581
use that space to draw and to handle touch events. This kind

15
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,886
of view setup is hierarchical, as you might imagine, so,

16
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:58,824
you can imagine that you have some view, like maybe this is

17
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,960
the view that contains your entire UI for an MVC.

18
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:05,130
And then, you've got some sub views maybe they're buttons,

19
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:08,233
or whatever, and they might be inside a view,

20
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,602
like let's say a stack view or something like that.

21
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,172
And, maybe those are in another view, okay? So,

22
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:16,075
you can see how these things are hierarchical, right?

23
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,311
You're building your views in a hierarchy,

24
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,848
a view hierarchy we call it, okay? Now,

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,752
these views can overlap, obviously.

26
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,089
And, they also, even if you have a view inside a view, so

27
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,657
a view, let's say in this view right here,

28
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,427
if you had another view inside it, it could actually extend

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,665
outside the bounds of its parent, that's legal. And,

30
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,134
you can set a switch in the view whether it's going to

31
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,871
clip, and only show this part, or whether it'll allow this

32
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:50,742
thing to draw outside of its parent, okay? So,

33
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,478
that's how we build our user interface,

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,113
is by kinda grouping these things together.

35
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,116
You're totally familiar with that in the calculator.

36
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,553
And, when you build something like this, every view ends up

37
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,857
having a single super view, right? That's the view that

38
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,893
it's inside. And, any given view could have

39
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,230
any number of sub-views, okay? Like the stack views could

40
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:14,600
have any number of things stacked inside of whatever.

41
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:18,604
The sub-views, you can find them for a view by looking at

42
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,240
this VAR, the CUI view VAR called sub-views.

43
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:25,210
You see it's an array of UI view there, and,

44
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,279
we'll talk a little later about the order of those

45
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,450
sub-views matters. And that's it basically,

46
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:35,287
okay? That's how we represent this new hierarchy.

47
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:40,225
There is a UI window in iOS, but it almost doesn't matter,

48
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,027
okay? You're never gonna interact with it.

49
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,130
There's always only one, per app. Actually, you could have

50
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,767
more than one if you had like an external screen, okay?

51
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,705
Like you were doing, what do we call, the, the screen cast,

52
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:57,709
it's not coming to me, where you can, have a second screen.

53
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,345
I can't think of it but, like on Apple TV,

54
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,180
you could have a second screen for

55
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:05,984
your device. Whatever, so then you might have two UI windows,

56
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,452
but it wouldn't matter cuz you're almost never gonna

57
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,588
create one or send a message to one or whatever. So,

58
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,925
it's all about views, it's all about this view hierarchy that

59
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,694
we're gonna build okay, in iOS. It's unlike on the Mac,

60
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,829
where of course the Mac you've got windows, right,

61
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,899
separate windows. You don't really have that, in iOS,

62
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:25,504
not enough room really to do that. This hierarchy

63
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,574
is most often constructed in Xcode graphically.

64
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,677
Like you did with the calculator, okay? But,

65
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,745
you can build this hierarchy in code.

66
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,181
The two methods are add subview, and

67
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,450
remove from super view, that's putting them in and

68
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,186
taking them out., Notice that add subview is sent

69
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:44,022
to the future super view of the view saying, hey,

70
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,059
or add this sub view to yourself. Remove from subview

71
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,195
is actually sent to the view you want to remove, okay?

72
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,565
So, remove from subview from super view rather is kind of

73
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,668
like remove yourself from your super view, okay?

74
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,839
Where does the view hierarchy start? It starts

75
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,077
right at the top, in that MVC that we see in the storyboard,

76
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,446
there's a view that fills that whole space.

77
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,682
There is a pointer from your view controller to that top

78
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:15,854
level view, okay? That pointer is called view. So,

79
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,522
if you look at view controller, right,

80
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,523
everyone knows what view controller is?

81
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,826
That's where you put a lot of your code in the calculator,

82
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,762
right? Where you wired up all your outlets and actions.

83
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,032
That class, view Controller has a var called view.

84
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,267
You haven't used it yet. But,

85
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,437
it is a pointer to the top level UI View. Okay, and

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,573
that's an important view to have a pointer to because

87
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,642
you're gonna be adding subviews to it, etcetera,

88
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,011
especially if you're doing it programmatically.

89
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:39,578
You really need this var so

90
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,882
you can call add subview on it and put some things in there.

91
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,484
And, this view is automatically hooked up for

92
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,487
you, in your storyboard. So, you don't have to do anything.

93
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,823
It's just automatically hooked up, okay? And,

94
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,060
this top level view is the view whose bounds will change,

95
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,496
for example, when you rotate your device, right?

96
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:01,767
The bounds go from being tall and thin, to being short and

97
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,237
wide, okay? That's the bounds of this top level view.

98
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,006
Now, when you change the bounds of this top over view,

99
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,875
if you have constrains, like if you put it in

100
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,944
the calculator where we tied the stack view to the edges?

101
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,714
When those edges change, of course, the stack view gets

102
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,550
pulled around and stretched. And, the stack view knows how

103
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,786
to resize and distribute the things inside of it.

104
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,088
That's part of what the stack view does. That's pretty much

105
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,258
all it does actually. So that's why rotating,

106
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,194
changing the bounds of this top view cause a ripple effect

107
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:33,765
where everything re-positions inside, okay? Now,

108
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:37,002
let's talk a little bit about initializing a UI View,

109
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,306
okay? As always we want to try to avoid doing an initializer

110
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,009
if we can just get away with just saying equals whatever,

111
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,778
but if you have to have an initializer because you just

112
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,649
feel like you just can't initialize a VAR somehow

113
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,719
else. Then you have to be careful with UIView because it

114
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,922
actually has two important initializers, okay?

115
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,391
One of them is required, that's the second one,

116
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:03,528
init with coder. That init is the init that's used to create

117
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,699
the UIView when it's coming out of a storyboard, okay?

118
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,701
So, if you built this view by dragging it out into

119
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,372
your storyboard, when the storyboard gets reconstituted

120
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,108
at run time, then this is the init that's gonna get

121
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,844
controlled, init with coder. The init with frame,

122
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,746
that's the init that you're going to call if you create

123
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:24,616
a view in code, okay? And, that frame that you're doing,

124
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:28,687
specifying is the frame of this view in its super view,

125
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,455
in other words where it's going to be, where

126
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:35,093
this view is going to be. And, it is legal to, to just do

127
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,731
init with no arguments. That's gonna essentially be ZeroRect.

128
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,799
You're just gonna put it, like,

129
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,468
up here in the left-hand corner really, really small.

130
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,139
You can set a frame later to move it. Anyway, since you

131
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,374
have two of these things, and one of them is required,

132
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,644
the second one, you're gonna end up implementing both,

133
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,547
okay? Because you're gonna want your views to be able to

134
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,517
work from storyboards or you want people to be able to,

135
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,386
you know, instantiate them from code, okay? So,

136
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,356
I recommend putting, all your initialization

137
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,359
code in something like a set up function here. And

138
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,728
then, override both of these two and

139
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,695
call set up from both of them.

140
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,931
That way they'll both be doing exactly the same set up,

141
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,234
right? Makes sense, kinda obvious. But, I just wanna

142
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,336
make sure you know you gotta do both of these.

143
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:22,407
[COUGH] All right, another initialization mechanism that

144
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,876
you can do for UI view, but only works for

145
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,378
views coming out of storyboards,

146
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,014
is to put your code in this method awakeFromNib().

147
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,217
Okay, awakeFromNib() is actually called on any object

148
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,420
that comes out of a storyboard, okay? But,

149
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:40,692
not called at all in you call an object in code. And, so,

150
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,562
you can, you know, put same kind of set up stuff that you

151
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,064
would put in the other one as long as you're fine with your

152
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,301
view only working when it's coming from a storyboard,

153
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,804
okay? All right. So, now let's talk about the drawing.

154
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,006
Okay, I've got this UI view and I wanna draw.

155
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,843
Well, before I can show you how to draw, you know,

156
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,546
draw something inside of these Your custom view, and I need

157
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,083
to talk about some types, some data types, okay, the first

158
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:09,120
one here is CG float. So, we don't use doubles or float,

159
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,257
I haven't really talked about the float struct in Swift, but

160
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,391
it's just like double. It's just,

161
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,761
float is single precision, and double is double precisions,

162
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,230
that's why it's called a double.

163
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,532
But we don't use floats or doubles when we're drawing,

164
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,835
we use this special struct called CGFloat,

165
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,072
okay? And that means that sometimes, you're going to be

166
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,908
doing calculations in doubles and then you're gonna want to

167
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,777
draw, with the result you're gonna have to convert it

168
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,948
to a CGFloat. By doing CGFloat called as initializer,

169
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,618
there's an initializer for CGFloat that takes a double

170
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,754
luckily and the other takes a float, okay?

171
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,790
So always using CGFloats and you'll run into some trouble

172
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,461
here and there, because you're trying to pass doubles into

173
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:54,266
API that takes CGFloats, cuz it's drawing API, okay?

174
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,901
There's a couple of other obvious structs.

175
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:59,471
There's CGPoint that just has two bars in it, one is the x,

176
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:03,241
and one is the y, tight? That represents a point and then

177
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,611
a CGSize, same thing, a struct with two things, a width and

178
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:11,182
a height. Okay, those are easy. Then there's CGRect.

179
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:15,620
CGRect gets it's own slide because even though it's

180
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,323
obvious, it has an origin which is a CGPoint and

181
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,525
a size which is a size, right, it's a rectangle,

182
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:24,262
has an origin and a size. It also has a lot of methods on

183
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,566
it, okay? Cool methods you can use or vars and

184
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,102
methods like finding the minimum x value

185
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:35,974
of this rectangle or the mid y point of this thing or

186
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,510
even intersect this with another rectangle and

187
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:42,013
give me the intersecting part like this slashed area here,

188
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,151
okay? Or this one intersects which says does this rect

189
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,788
intersect this other rect. You can imagine there are a couple

190
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,123
of dozen of these kinds of utility methods.

191
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,491
So you want to definitely get to know them so

192
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,561
you don't end up writing these methods yourself when you want

193
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,365
to intersect two rects or whatever, okay? So those

194
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,635
are the main types that we are going to use when we draw. So

195
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:07,172
you're gonna be familiar with those types. All right, let's

196
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,708
talk about the coordinate system we're gonna draw in in

197
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,413
our view, okay? The origin is in the upper left, upper left,

198
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,583
okay. It's not lower left like Cartesian coordinates or

199
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,250
like the Mac okay,

200
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:23,822
when you draw on the Mac, if you're building a Mac app,

201
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:23,955
it's in the upper left.

202
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,424
That means increasing y means you're moving down the screen,

203
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:30,228
okay. So if you look at this point I created up here, 535,

204
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,100
notice it's 500 over in x, but only 35 down in y.

205
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,636
That's why it's way over on that side there,

206
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,706
okay. The points that we are talking about here in drawing

207
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,642
when I mention all of this, or

208
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:47,312
the unit if you will are called points, okay. Now

209
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:52,417
a point is not a pixel. Some iOS devices are extremely high

210
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,354
resolution like the IPhone Plus, the IPhone 6 Plus, very,

211
00:10:56,356 --> 00:11:00,692
very high resolution. It has three pixels per point, okay.

212
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,727
Some of the other devices have two pixels per point,

213
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,864
some have one. Now yo're always drawing in points.

214
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,266
Usually, you do't care too much about the pixels.

215
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,402
If you have a lot of pixels, it just means the lines

216
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,570
that you draw are gonna look really smooth or

217
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,973
the images that you have are gonna be really detailed.

218
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,175
You are gonna be able to use a lot of image data

219
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,245
to draw them, okay? But if you do care, and

220
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,682
actually in assignment three, you are gonna care, so

221
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,385
pay attention. If you do care, you can find out by asking

222
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,021
a UIView what is your content scale factor?

223
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:35,927
That's basically how many pixels per point okay.

224
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,830
The boundaries where you draw in, so this is super important

225
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,732
and this is where a lot of confusion comes in,

226
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,701
that's why I spend a lot of time in this even though it's

227
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,604
very simple but people just get these things messed up.

228
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,808
Let's talk about the rectangle in which you draw, okay,

229
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,843
cuz you're gonna draw inside a rectangle. When you

230
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,547
are drawing, you're using this var in your UI view.

231
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,883
It's called bounds. It's a CGRect. That is the rectangle

232
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,920
in which you're drawing in your own coordinate system, in

233
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,956
the coordinate system you're drawing in, okay. So any time

234
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,028
you're writing drawing code, you're using this, okay?

235
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,332
There's another thing called frame, which is also CGRect,

236
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:18,103
which people confuse between these two. But frame is

237
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:21,072
completely different. It has a completely different purpose,

238
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,975
and it's in a completely different coordinate system.

239
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:27,212
Okay, so if try to use frame instead of bounds,

240
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,947
it might work in certain circumstances but

241
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,183
then be messed up in others. So what's frame about?

242
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:36,054
Frame is about where your view is in it's super view?

243
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,791
Frame is a rectangle, a CG rect that completely encloses

244
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:44,929
you in your super views coordinate system. Okay, so

245
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,632
when I wanna put some view somewhere,

246
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,769
I have to specify where in it's SuperView it goes.

247
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,238
I do that by specifying it's frame. And of course,

248
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,607
since I'm talking about putting it into SuperView,

249
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,375
that's in the SuperView's coordinate system,

250
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,678
not in the drawing, coordinate system on the inside there,

251
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,049
okay? Similarly, centre, a lot of people think, great,

252
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,486
that's the center of my view. But it's not, okay?

253
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,489
That's the centre of your view in your SuperViews coordinate

254
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,992
system. So that's positioning you, okay?

255
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,960
Frame and center are positioning you.

256
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,562
They have nothing to do with your drawing.

257
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,865
When you're drawing, you're using your bounds, okay? So

258
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,735
I do not want to see you using frame inside your drawing

259
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:28,072
code, or centre. Got it? And I'll emphasize this again in

260
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:33,378
the demo. All right, so one thing about frame and

261
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,414
centre, you might think that the size and

262
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,149
width are going to be the same for the frame and

263
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:42,420
centre, but they're not because views can be rotated.

264
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,856
If you had a rotated view like view B, okay,

265
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:50,128
it's bounds is 200 wide by 250 high you see that, but

266
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,432
look at his frame 320 by 320 why? Because this is

267
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,002
the smallest rectangle in the super views coordinate system

268
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:03,241
that will completely contain this rotated view, okay?

269
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,544
So the width and height are not the same, okay?

270
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:10,782
This is the frame 320 by 320, this is the bounds. When

271
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:14,152
you're drawing in B, you don't even know you're rotated, so

272
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,055
you want to make sure that you're using

273
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:21,726
this coordinate system right here, bounds, okay?

274
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,497
All right, creating views, okay, most of the time you're

275
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,167
creating views in your story board by dragging them out.

276
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,736
Now if you have a custom view that's drawing something

277
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,406
custom like today we're gonna do a thing where we draw

278
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:40,278
a face view, it's gonna be a view Okay.

279
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,448
Looks like this, got a couple eyes. Smiley face, okay?

280
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,985
I'm drawing, it's got a skull there. When I'm drawing this,

281
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:51,155
there's no face view in the object palate, right?

282
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,657
I can't drag that out into my story board.

283
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,627
So, how do I get my face view to appear somewhere in

284
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,794
my story board. Well, the answer is,

285
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,697
I'm going to drag out a generic view, okay,

286
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,401
a generic UI view, unsubclassed UI view, and then

287
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,038
I'm going to change it, edit it in this identity inspector,

288
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,641
which I'll show you in the demo to change the class of

289
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,110
it, so it's a subclass of UI view. And it's in that

290
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,545
subclass of UI view that I'm gonna put all my drawing code,

291
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:19,751
all my face drawing code, okay? Now on rare occasion,

292
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,854
you will create a view in code, okay. You do that just

293
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:26,257
by doing, calling UIView's little constructor here.

294
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,694
You're gonna use the one with frame, not the one with coder,

295
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,897
okay. You can also do UIView with no arguments,

296
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,033
that means the tiny little UIView.

297
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,734
You'll have to set it's frame otherwise.

298
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,671
So here's what it looks like to create a view in code.

299
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,606
Here I just created a rectangle which is 20/20, 150.

300
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,877
So that's like 20, 20, 150. So this is this rectangle

301
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,848
right about there and the, so

302
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,218
then I'm creating a view. This view happens to be a UI label.

303
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,087
UI label is just a sub class UI view.

304
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,756
So it' s UI button, so it's UI stack view. All of these

305
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,492
things are just sub classes of UI view. So I'm creating a sub

306
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,928
code view using that frame thing using that frame thing,

307
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,431
okay? I'm even setting the elabels text, all right?

308
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:10,401
Then I'm going to say view, let's say this code is

309
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:15,473
in the view controller, say view.addsubvie.

310
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,109
Then all the sudden it's gonna appear here,

311
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,780
okay? Here's that 20/20. And it's 100 by 50,

312
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:27,986
okay? That's it. Very simple to add views with code,

313
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:32,690
okay? Add subview. All right, custom view. So why do I want

314
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,759
to create my own custom view subclass?

315
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,762
Obviously you want to have a smiley face, okay?

316
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,698
So you need to create your own custom one to do that. And

317
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,568
you might have some pinches or swipes or

318
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,304
something, which we'll do next week. For your face,

319
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,040
you need a custom view to do those things, okay? So let's

320
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,944
talk about the drawing end of that today. How do I draw?

321
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,514
It's really easy. You're just gonna subclass UI view and

322
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,150
you're gonna override this one method,

323
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:02,720
drawRect, okay? DrawRect takes one argument,

324
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,858
which is an optimization only, which is what part of

325
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,559
the view the system wants you to draw.

326
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,261
It might want you to draw the whole thing.

327
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,631
But maybe it just wants you to draw the eyes, okay?

328
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,399
Now you can ignore that and

329
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,868
draw the whole thing anyway, and it will work. Or

330
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,970
if you can efficiently just draw the eyes,

331
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,739
then you might decide to just draw the eyes, okay. But

332
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,008
this argument right here is purely an optimization.

333
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,580
It can be ignored if you want. Okay, never call this method.

334
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,717
If you ever call this method in the code you submit for

335
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,286
homework, I'll be personally going over and

336
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,754
slapping you on the wrist, okay?

337
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,024
Because this, this is never, ever, under any circumstances,

338
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,859
no exceptions are you calling this thing.

339
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:46,030
The system calls drawRect. You never call it. So,

340
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,767
how do you get your face to draw? If you want it drawn.

341
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,837
Let's say the eye is closed. And you want to draw the face

342
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,840
so the eyes are closed. Well you call this method here set

343
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:59,010
needs display on your view. And that tells the system,

344
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,412
hey this view needs to be redrawn. And

345
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,782
the view at some point in the future when it's appropriate,

346
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:08,986
will call your drawRect, okay? Now why is it done this way?

347
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,688
Well if you think about it. Your view lives in

348
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,690
an environment where there might be subviews and

349
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,792
you're in SuperView and they're overlapping.

350
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,461
There's all kinds of things happening. And

351
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,831
you can't just run along and redraw one of those things

352
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,332
okay they might be transparent,

353
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:25,169
seeing through to each other, the system has to manage that

354
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,772
okay and there's also performance reasons to do it.

355
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,576
You might change, close the eyes, start frowning, etc,

356
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:35,279
the nose starts running I don't know and all those

357
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:35,880
things are happening all at once,

358
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,683
we don't wanna redraw it every single time. The, one of them

359
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,852
changes. You wanna wait until all of them have changed and

360
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,922
then draw once your new face, okay? So the system is the one

361
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,159
that decides. Now this is setNeedsDisplay() in Rect.

362
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,495
Just lets you set this little rectangle right here.

363
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,497
So this is an optimized version,

364
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,532
an optimized version of setNeedsDisplay() in Rect.

365
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,868
Maybe just call it with the i's. Okay,

366
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,336
if you know that only the eyes have changed.

367
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,939
But this is how you get a view to redraw, okay?

368
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,976
All right, so how do I implement this drawRect thing,

369
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,678
okay? I got this drawRect thing, how do I implement it?

370
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,848
There's two ways, really. There is a, kind of a C-like,

371
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,485
a non-object oriented. In Swift, it's just functions,

372
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,855
global functions way of doing it called Core Graphics.

373
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,692
Okay, Core Graphics and then there's object oriented way

374
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,762
using a class called UIBezierPath, okay? They're

375
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,466
both using Core Graphics underneath the covers so I'm

376
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,936
gonna talk a little bit about the Core Graphics Concepts and

377
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:35,239
they're going to apply to UIBezierPath as you can see.

378
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,074
So what are the concepts of Core Graphics?

379
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,644
Very simple. First, you're gonna get a context

380
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,914
to draw in. So that context might be drawing on screen.

381
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,849
That's the context you'd want if you're in drawRect.

382
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,952
But you could have other contexts like drawing for

383
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:51,522
a printer, drawing into an off screen buffer, okay?

384
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,523
Those are all contexts of draw so

385
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,394
that's the first thing you do. In if you're using this

386
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,963
kind of like C-like function one you're gonna use this

387
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,300
UI graphics to get current context inside of drawRect

388
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,834
to get the context that's appropriate for

389
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:08,573
drawRect, okay? So then number two is you create paths.

390
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,076
So these paths are made of arcs and lines, rectangles,

391
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:16,447
circles, whatever. You're pu- putting together these Paths,

392
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,748
this path that you're building, okay?

393
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,051
And that's the thing that's gonna be drawn, okay?

394
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,888
So you build this path. Then you set attributes that you're

395
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,159
gonna draw this path with like, the color of the lines.

396
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,528
Any fonts if you're doing texts.

397
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,797
Textures if you're filling things with textures.

398
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,765
Linewidths, linecaps, those kinds of things.

399
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:38,402
You set all those things up and then you stroke the path

400
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,372
which means draw a line everywhere the path is or

401
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:45,643
you fill the path which means fill in the space

402
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:49,547
contained by the path with some color or texture, okay?

403
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,450
That's it, this is the basic concept of how you draw.

404
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:58,122
The UIBezierPath does the same okay it's

405
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:04,395
just the UIBezierPath It has methods to draw.

406
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:08,799
Line two, arch two, those kind of things instead of having

407
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,636
these great functions. You know these global functions.

408
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:15,439
You use UI color to set the stroke and fill colors.

409
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,709
This is a class we'll talk about and then when it comes

410
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:22,046
to stroking in fill, those are methods on UIBezierPath.

411
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,748
So UIBezierPath just encapsulates

412
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,783
all that core graphics staff in to a nice class.

413
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,219
It's nice because you can find everything you want.

414
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,821
Basically everything you want to do to draw except for

415
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:34,225
colors, fonts, texts and images. Those four things

416
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:38,329
are not in UIBezierPath but all other drawing is in there.

417
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,832
Okay, so how do you do this? Lets, I'm only gonna talk

418
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,368
about the UIBezierPathway cuz it's object oriented,

419
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,971
we love object oriented programming here. So

420
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,974
here's how you would, create a path and draw some.

421
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,343
So we're gonna do a triangle. Okay, so first

422
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:56,080
I create a UIBezierPath, okay theyre are one initializers

423
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,049
with argueness we're gonna use the one we just created,

424
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,885
a blank, blank path. Then, we're gonna move around.

425
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:04,488
So, I'm gonna move to 8050, which is like right here.

426
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,693
Let's say it's 160 wide and 250 high, or something.

427
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:12,630
So, 8060s right about there. Then, I'm going to add a line

428
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,566
to this point over here, 140, 150. Remember,

429
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,403
origin is up here, positive numbers are going down, okay?

430
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,506
Gonna add another line right here. Okay, to 10150, and

431
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,877
then I'm going to close the path, there's a method called

432
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:31,082
close path, and that just goes back to the starting point,

433
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:31,749
so that closes it, and boom,

434
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:36,087
I've created a triangle. Now I've misled you a little here,

435
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:40,124
because no drawing on screen would actually happen if you

436
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,359
put this in your draw rect. Okay,

437
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,127
if you put these lines and this code in your draw rect,

438
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:46,063
nothing would happen. Because all you've done here is

439
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,367
create that path. You have not drawn it on screen.

440
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,903
You haven't stroked it or filled it. So how do we do

441
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:56,073
that? How do we get it onto screen? Well first of all,

442
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,942
we need to set the colors that we're gonna use to

443
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:03,047
stroke and fill. So I want my triangle to be red lines with

444
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,283
green fill in the middle. So I'm setting green color

445
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,919
as my fill color and red color as my stroke color.

446
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,857
Notice that I send these as to a UIColor. I don't send them

447
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,593
to the BezierPath. So it's kinda odd that you

448
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,462
do your setting of the colors by sending it to UIColor.

449
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,899
So we'll talk about UIColor green color, what that means

450
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,902
in a couple slides. So I'm setting my stroke and fill and

451
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,938
then here I'm saying the line width of my path to

452
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,443
three points, three points wide, okay? Now I can just say

453
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:37,615
path.fill and I get my filled path, see? Filled with green.

454
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:41,385
Notice there's no line around the outside. But then if I say

455
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,522
path stroke, now you get a line around the side. And

456
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:49,360
you can see it's red. And it's line width is three, got it?

457
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,929
So you're going to have code like this in your draw erect.

458
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:56,300
If you wanted your view to be a view of a triangle.

459
00:23:56,302 --> 00:24:01,405
Okay, any questions about that? All right [COUGH].

460
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,841
Now, you can use UI Bezier Path to draw more

461
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:07,311
complicated things like rounded rects and circles and

462
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,214
things like that, especially by using a lot of

463
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,349
the initializers of UI Bezier Path, but

464
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,853
there's also methods there. So you're going to have to study

465
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,221
UI Bezier Path and see what it can do,

466
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:20,691
okay, it can do quite a lot. Another interesting thing

467
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,528
about UIBezierPath is you can set it as a clipping path. So,

468
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,697
let's say you were drawing a playing card, right?

469
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,533
Playing cards have rounded rects. They never have sharp

470
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,769
corners, right? They have rounded rects.

471
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,839
Well, you could Could create a UIBezierPath here using this,

472
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:38,776
create a rounded rect, set it as the clipping path, and

473
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,378
then just draw your card in the inside.

474
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,681
And it would never draw in those corners,

475
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,684
cuz it would be clipped to the rounded rect. Okay?

476
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:50,421
So, addClip is kind of a cool Bezier path method.

477
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,490
The Bezier path can also do hit detection. So

478
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:56,227
you can see whether a point is like inside the triangle,

479
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:58,863
right? If you have that Bezier path that's the triangle, you

480
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,131
can do hit detection on it, whether it contains a point.

481
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,667
So that's kinda cool, too, right, doing some game or

482
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,504
something and people have to touch on a certain kind of

483
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,806
funny shaped thing, not a rectangular thing.

484
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,742
Then it's nice to be able to do hit detection with it.

485
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,477
Okay? And there's lots and lots of other stuff,

486
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,180
you need to check the documentation. All right,

487
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,083
UIColor. We saw that UIColor, green color thing,

488
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:23,120
on the previous slide. This, what kind of method is this?

489
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,523
Do you guys remember from last lecture? The green color.

490
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,025
What kind of method? Type method or

491
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,128
instance method? It's a type method.

492
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,497
Right because we're not sending it to a UI color,

493
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,366
we're sending it to the type, UIColor.

494
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,903
UIColor's a class and so we're sending this method to it.

495
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,739
So it would be defined as static or

496
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:45,976
class, funk, green color inside UIColor class.

497
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:51,015
Okay? By the way, you can also create colors, not

498
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:54,018
just picking these well-known colors like green color. But

499
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,155
there are initializers for RGB, red, green, blue. HSB,

500
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,891
that's hue, saturation, and br-brightness. You can even

501
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,095
set, create a color that's a pattern. Okay? It's like some

502
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,097
image that you have. You'd make a pattern out of it.

503
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,233
And when it draws, it will be drawing with that pattern.

504
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:14,204
It's kind of cool. Here we see views have background colors.

505
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,574
So you've already seen that. We set the background colors

506
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,677
of our buttons in the calculator. You noticed that

507
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,145
when we did that in the attributes inspector,

508
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,581
we had to scroll down to the bottom because the attribute

509
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,050
inspector is object oriented and it was showing all

510
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,886
the inherited thing. Well we had to go down to The UIView

511
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,188
level to set the background color of our buttons, okay,

512
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,594
cuz button inherits that from UIView. Okay? Interesting

513
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:40,130
thing about colors, they can have transparency.

514
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,833
Okay, meaning they kind of show through. That's called

515
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,436
alpha. How many people have heard the term alpha when it

516
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,639
comes to drawing? Okay, so less than half of you.

517
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,208
So alpha just means how transparent it is.

518
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,544
An alpha of zero means fully transparent.

519
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:56,380
So if you had bright red but it was alpha zero

520
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,582
you wouldn't see anything because its fully transparent.

521
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,352
You're seeing completely through it with no blocking.

522
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:04,355
Alpha of 1 means fully opaque, meaning you would not

523
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:07,191
see a single pixel of anything behind something that was

524
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:10,728
fully opaque. And between 0 and 1 is various degrees

525
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,465
of being able to see through. Okay, that's called alpha. And

526
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,667
you can create colors, like here's a yellow.

527
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,337
By sending this message colorWithAlphaComponent, okay,

528
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,639
is this a type method or

529
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:26,243
an instance method? Raise your hand if you think it's a type

530
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:31,048
method. Raise your hand if you think it's an instance method.

531
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,583
Hardly anyone raised their hand for either of them.

532
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:34,518
That's great. But if you were to raise your hand for

533
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,186
instance method you are correct. Okay.

534
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,989
This is an instance method. That's because we use this

535
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,760
type method yellow color to get an instance of a color and

536
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,396
then we sent it this instance method

537
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:49,199
to get a half transparent version of yellow. So

538
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,568
this is half transparent yellow right here, and

539
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,872
if we drew with it it would draw yellow in our view, but

540
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,274
we would be able to see through, to things behind,

541
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,845
perhaps even to other views, like our super view, behind.

542
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,282
If you want to draw with transparency in your view.

543
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,651
If you want to draw with colors that are transparent.

544
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:13,424
You have to set in your view this far opaque to be false.

545
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:17,061
As a performance optimization the system has to assume

546
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,429
the view is opaque okay?

547
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,065
That it doesn't draw with transparency. That's because

548
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,667
you can imagine things that are transparent overlapping,

549
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,904
think about the work that the system has to do to figure out

550
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,906
what's showing through from behind.

551
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:31,008
Okay? That kind of compositing,

552
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,877
it's called, takes processor power and memory.

553
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,414
Okay? So, it's gonna assume that everything is opaque. So

554
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,050
it doesn't have to do that, but if you are drawing with

555
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,953
transparency, that's fine, just set this opaque to false,

556
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,356
to let the system know, no I'm not opaque. I'm gonna draw

557
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,293
with transparency. Now another thing that's cool,

558
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,529
is you can make your entire view transparent,

559
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,533
by setting the alpha property on the view itself, okay? So

560
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,002
you could draw your whole view, your triangle,

561
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,038
let's say, set the transparency to 0.5, and

562
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,906
you'd have a half transparent triangle,

563
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,842
even though you drew all with opaque colors,

564
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:07,711
you'd still have a half transparent triangle because

565
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:11,381
you set your alpha to 0.5. Okay? Using alpha is

566
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:15,686
really cool for doing effects like fading views out. Okay,

567
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:18,422
sometimes you want a view just to fade out over time,

568
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,790
you want to animate that,

569
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,158
alpha is one of the things you can animate,

570
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,560
we'll talk about animate in a couple of weeks, so

571
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:27,131
alpha is cool for doing that. All right,

572
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,633
now let's talk about this view transparency and

573
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,835
how that works when you're drawing with transparency.

574
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,938
If you have non-opaque views, okay, say they're drawn with

575
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,375
transparency, then what happens is that sub views list

576
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,311
that shows all of the sub views is in order

577
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:45,149
where the first thing in the sub views list is in the back

578
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,550
okay. The next thing is in front of that,

579
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,285
and the next one's in front of that, the next one's in front

580
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,189
of that and so it's gonna show through like that, get it? So

581
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,690
the sub views list matters okay.

582
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:57,928
The sub views list is built by add subview, everything is

583
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,330
always put in the front when you call add subview. But,

584
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,767
there's another method called insert subviewat, that let you

585
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,370
put it anywhere you want. You put a subview in the back.

586
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,038
Like if you say, insert subview at zero,

587
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,675
it will put it up at the back. Okay. So, just note that,

588
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:16,180
that subviews orders obviously matters. You can

589
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:20,484
completely hide a view by setting it's hidden to true.

590
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,087
If you set it's hidden to true, it will not receive any

591
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,257
events, no touch events. Nor will it draw what it draws.

592
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,560
It will still be in view hierarchy, okay, but

593
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,129
it's as if it's not there. Now why would you want this? Well

594
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,431
you might have a view that only appears when a certain

595
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:37,568
button is in a certain state. So you put it there.

596
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,903
You set it hidden. When the button goes to that state you

597
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:44,341
unhide it and it'll appear. Now to be frank you probably

598
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,944
animate it's appearance with alpha okay so

599
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,111
it would zooooo appear like that.

600
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:51,648
Instead of jumping on screen that's kind of disconcerting.

601
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,784
But you still would probably use hidden to have it hidden

602
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,319
in the first place. Because you wouldn't want it for

603
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,688
example getting a touch of answer on like that until

604
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,359
it was shown. What about drawing text.

605
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:07,164
You do not draw text using a UiBezier path. Text is

606
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:12,069
really just a bunch of Bezier paths in a font. A font really

607
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:14,905
defines a bunch of Bezier paths for each character,

608
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:19,943
each gliff. It's called. So we have higher level ways of

609
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,880
drawing text by basically saying here's a string,

610
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,883
draw it. Okay that's a high level way to get all those

611
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,452
bezier paths drawn, you don't want to be dealing with that

612
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,588
at the UI bezier path level for sure. But most the time,

613
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,325
we don't draw text even in our drawRect. We draw it by using

614
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,728
UILabel which you're used to all ready, okay?

615
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,997
We just have a rectangle? Boom, we put it on here.

616
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,432
If we wanted to say hello on this guy's forehead,

617
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,969
we might put a UILabel right there say hello. Okay, but

618
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,305
what if we did want in our draw rect.

619
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:51,241
What if we wanted to put some text in here and

620
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,343
we didn't want to put it as a subview,

621
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:57,214
a UILabel subview on our face view. And the way you do that

622
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,584
is with a class called NS attributed string Okay,

623
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,587
NSAttributedString. And you create it by,

624
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,658
this constructor here. Usually you pass a string in here.

625
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,929
What an attributed string is, it's a string that for every

626
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,832
character has a dictionary of attributes that say how to

627
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,903
draw it. And those attributes are things like, the color of

628
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:24,241
the character or of the glyph, the font to use obviously,

629
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,409
maybe a background color,

630
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,545
those kind of things, right? You have a dictionary that has

631
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,714
all those kinds of settings for every single character.

632
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,417
Now often you have long runs of characters that have

633
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,752
exactly the same color and font or whatever, so

634
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:38,789
you would have one dictionary for all of them. But

635
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,725
that is the basic way that AttributedString works. And

636
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,761
once you have an attributed string, okay, maybe you've set

637
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,431
these dictionaries on the characters, then you draw it

638
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,334
in your drawRect by saying text, that's the attributed

639
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:53,737
string. You send the method here, drawAtPoint,

640
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:57,674
and then you give it a point. And it's going to draw that

641
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,811
text with the upper left corner being at that point.

642
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,480
So, if I wanted to do that hello and I would have drew

643
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,351
it right here. The hello would appear like this. Okay,

644
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,419
this is the upper left and it would appear,

645
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:13,256
the text would appear here. Okay, got that? And I could

646
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:18,228
find out how big this is gonna be by using this size method,

647
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,833
okay, the size property, actually of attributed string,

648
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,837
okay? So that's how we draw a text. Now this is a little

649
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,673
bit of a nasty class to use, to be honest,

650
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,176
NSAttributedString, for a couple of reasons. But

651
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,480
all the reasons come from the fact this is an Objective-C

652
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:40,517
class that really didn't get a very good Swift treatment yet,

653
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,820
okay? So there's two major differences

654
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,157
that make using it a kind of complicated in Swift,

655
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,129
okay? One is that mutability is not done with var and

656
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:55,165
let. Okay, normally if you wanted an array that you can

657
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:58,535
add things to do, you would just say var x array, and

658
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,337
since it's a var you can add to it. Okay,

659
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,974
if you said let x of an array, then you couldn't add to it.

660
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,976
Well that's not true for NSAttributedString.

661
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:08,078
You can't say var NSAttributedString,

662
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,448
that's still immutable. The way you do mutability is with

663
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,185
NSMutableAttributedString, it's a different class, okay?

664
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,687
So if you wanna built an attributed string and

665
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,824
start setting the attributes on it, you need to use

666
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:23,293
MutableAttributedString instead, okay?

667
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,362
You create it the same way with some string but

668
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,898
now you can set the attributes of it or whatever. So

669
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,634
that's one thing that's kinda weird, okay? Is this mutable,

670
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:33,737
you have to use this mutable version of it.

671
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,307
By the way, NSAttributedString is not a string, a Swift

672
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,811
string, nor is it an NSString even an object string. It's

673
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:44,581
its own thing. It does have a property string and another

674
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,317
property called mutableString that will give you back

675
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:52,389
a string/NSString using that bridging thing but

676
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,625
it itself is not a string. You can't pass it as an argument

677
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,461
to something that's accepting a string, okay?

678
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:00,397
NSAttributedString is a different thing. Now,

679
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,933
the second thing that's difficult with Swift and

680
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:07,337
attributed string is the range here, okay?

681
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,505
You're trying to set attributes.

682
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:10,774
This is how you set attributes in the thing.

683
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:11,007
Here's the dictionary.

684
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,443
I'm gonna show you what's in that dictionary in a second.

685
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,113
And you're trying to set it for a range of characters in

686
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,316
the string. You want the font or a color to be something for

687
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:22,686
a range of characters. Well, this range is not a Range,

688
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:27,157
it's an NSRange. Okay, NSRange is different than Range.

689
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,993
And NSRange, the index is in here.

690
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:35,265
Okay, it's a struct also that has a start in and a range,

691
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,902
basically. A distance, start in a distance. But

692
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:43,240
these indexes are into the Objective-C NSString. Now,

693
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,542
what's the difference between a Objective-C NSString and

694
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,544
a Swift string? Well, as I told you before,

695
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,914
a Swift string is fully Unicode compliant, okay? So,

696
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,550
things like emojis and stuff like that might be multiple

697
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:57,654
characters. So the length of an NSString might be different

698
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,989
then the length of a Swift string,

699
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:03,860
okay? Swift string has a lot of possible Unicodes in there,

700
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:07,264
whereas an NSString might not necessary do the full Unicode

701
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,399
treatment. So, bottom line, they're different.

702
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,302
Now, if you have just normal text which I hesitate to even

703
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:15,972
say that because of course you want to build apps that work

704
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:16,106
But if you have text where there's no Unicodes in there

705
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:19,609
worldwide.

706
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,711
that are multiple characters long.

707
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,480
You don't have emojis in there and stuff.

708
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,982
Then they're gonna be quite similar, these ranges, but

709
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,618
otherwise, you might have to be really careful to make sure

710
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,855
that you get the range to be the NSString range.

711
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,791
That might mean taking the Swift string that you have,

712
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:35,725
converting it to an NSString,

713
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,195
which is really easy cuz it's bridged automatically.

714
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:41,264
And then, looking into the NSString to see how long it is

715
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,267
and where things are. Okay, I apologize for this.

716
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,769
Of course, I have never worked for Apple, so

717
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,905
I have nothing to do with it. But, this is the way it is.

718
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,576
Hopefully, one day soon, Apple will come up with some

719
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,712
nice more Swifty way of doing this. What is in this,

720
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,348
by the way I'm not gonna ask you to do this very much in

721
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,251
your homework. Okay, so don't worry too much about that.

722
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:04,421
What are the attributes you could put in this dictionary?

723
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:05,789
Exactly what you would expect.

724
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:09,192
Okay, the foreground color is the color of the text.

725
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,994
The stroke width is how thick you're gonna

726
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:14,197
stroke the text. The FontAttributeName is the font,

727
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,634
the UIFont. There's a class called UIFont, okay?

728
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,170
You put those in a dictionary and then you can set that for

729
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:23,840
whichever characters you want in your attributed string.

730
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:27,377
Now let's talk about fonts, by the way. Fonts are super

731
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:31,047
important in iOS, okay? They are critical to the look and

732
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:34,017
feel of it. You can see there's all kinds of different

733
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:39,389
fonts here, right? You see some bold, some not, some kind

734
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:43,026
of heading fonts, there's system fonts like up here.

735
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:46,630
Look at the use of fonts here, how important that is, okay?

736
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:47,797
So fonts are very important and

737
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,765
if you're gonna build a good app,

738
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,767
you really gotta pay attention to the fonts.

739
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,237
So how do I get the fonts or pick the fonts that I want?

740
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,339
Well there's really three ways to do pick it,

741
00:37:56,341 --> 00:38:00,510
okay? Number one way is using prefered fonts. So,

742
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,013
preferred fonts are the fonts you're gonna use for

743
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:06,249
the user's content, okay? The user, the stuff the user is

744
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,652
actually, there, like if it's a calendar app,

745
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,288
then it's all of the things about their appointments and

746
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,423
things, okay? If it's the weather app,

747
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,425
it's the temperature and things like that.

748
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:19,262
Those are part of the user's content. You get these

749
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:23,600
mostly in storyboard by going to attributes inspector and

750
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,703
you pick the font. And we've only picked the system font

751
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,272
because we've always just had buttons, which is a system

752
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:32,575
font thing. But for content, you would pick in there

753
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:35,312
prefered font. Okay, and I'm gonna talk about what those

754
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:38,048
referred font styles are in a second. In code,

755
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,785
your gonna use this UIFont static type function called

756
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:44,654
preferredFontForTextStyle and say what kind of text

757
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,891
style you want and it's gonna give you UIFont, okay?

758
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:50,994
So what are these text styles? Okay, there's about eight or

759
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,297
nine of them, but some examples are headlines, body

760
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,600
font, footnote font, and you should use the one that's kind

761
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:01,871
of appropriate to what your UI's doing at that time, okay?

762
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,307
There's like caption font, a couple of other things,

763
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,011
all right? And so, you know, sometimes you play with these.

764
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,379
The difference between a caption and

765
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:12,549
a footnote can sometimes be subtle so

766
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:12,882
you might try both and

767
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,518
see which one really feels the best. But, you're gonna use

768
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,021
these various preferred fonts to build a cool looking

769
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,124
UI, okay, that's beautiful and all that.

770
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:24,227
The second kind of font thing is systems font, okay?

771
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,996
systemFontOfSize, boldSystemFontOfSize.

772
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:30,200
System font's what we'll been using in our calculator,

773
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,937
those go on system elements like buttons, okay,

774
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,972
that's where you would use a system font.

775
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,407
In our display in the calculator,

776
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,542
we probably shouldn't have used a system font there

777
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,811
because really what's in the display is kinda the user's

778
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,848
content. Probably we should've used a prefered font but

779
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,051
I hadn't shown you the slide yet so can't introduce it all

780
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,988
at once, okay? But that probably would be better.

781
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,191
And the kind of font we want to use there might be instead

782
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:58,361
of a, sometimes you want to use a specific font, okay,

783
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,664
so the third way here Is to use a specific kind of font.

784
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,901
Like maybe in the calculator display we wanna use something

785
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:05,969
that looks like LED segments.

786
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,171
You know what I'm talking about? The old style,

787
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,941
funny calculator thing back when we had LED displays.

788
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,578
[LAUGH] So we might wanna font this LED font which they make

789
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,982
those. In that case, you wanna check out UI font and

790
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,884
UI font descriptor, especially,

791
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:23,620
because those are how you pick a specific font from

792
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:27,090
a specific family, okay. Like the LED font family, okay.

793
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:31,728
So those are the three ways. Preferred system or highly

794
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,399
customized okay, how about drawing images? Just like

795
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,102
there's UILabel for drawing text, there's something called

796
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,571
UIImageView for drawing images. So, you could just put

797
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,707
an image if I wanted to put image on this guy's forehead,

798
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:48,711
I could just put UIImage here and have my image here. Okay,

799
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,213
put it as a sub view of my face view.

800
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,982
So, that's one way to do it. But, if I want to draw

801
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,686
UI image in my draw rack, it's very similar to the text,

802
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:59,122
I'm going to get a UI image, okay.

803
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,958
There's a number of ways. I'll show you here to do that.

804
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,360
But, the main way is you're gonna do it by name.

805
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:07,063
You're gonna put the image in that images.xcassets.

806
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,933
Do you remember that thing I kept moving out of the way

807
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:12,735
into supporting files? Okay Images.xcassets,

808
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:15,738
so you're gonna drag an image in there, give it a name, and

809
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,975
then you're gonna say image named that name and you're

810
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,912
gonna get a UIImage. This is optional because it's my fail.

811
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,448
Okay, you might have forgotten to drag that image in there or

812
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,751
something. Who knows? But once you have this UIImage in your

813
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,521
hand. By the way there are other ways you can do it.

814
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:32,956
You can create it from a file.

815
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,158
Just some image data you got from the Internet for example.

816
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,261
That's another way to create a UI image. You can even do it

817
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:42,532
by drawing graphics onto an off screen buffer. You have

818
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:47,237
that image in your hand, you draw it the same as the text.

819
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,440
You say draw at point. That's the upper left.

820
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,308
But you also can do what called draw erect.

821
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,944
Which will draw the image but scale it to fit this

822
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,548
rect, okay? Or you can draw it as a pattern which will

823
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,684
tile it okay? It will take that rect and use it as a tile

824
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,288
to fill in the rectangle. Okay, so this code would be

825
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,994
the kind of code that would be in your draw rect. Okay

826
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:14,697
the last thing here above you is redrawing on bounds change,

827
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:19,702
okay. When your view's bounds changes, what happens

828
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:25,241
to the face inside here? Okay so, if I had this face and

829
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:29,979
it was in a portrait thing here. Let's say it looked like

830
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:35,118
this, okay. Face. And I rotated my device in this

831
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,757
bounds of my view changed to be like this. Landscape.

832
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,293
You think well I'm a face would you have to redraw and

833
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:46,329
it would probably look about the same. The answer is not.

834
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:52,702
It would look like this, okay? It would get stretched out.

835
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:56,472
And that's cuz the default when your bounds change is to

836
00:42:56,474 --> 00:43:01,010
scale all the bits, to not redraw, okay? And that's

837
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:04,747
a performance thing as you can imagine. It's a lot more,

838
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,417
a lot easier just to stretch those bits out than to ask

839
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:11,220
draw rec to go again. So you can fix this though with this

840
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:14,591
property in your eye view called content mode. Okay,

841
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:20,063
UI content mode? And some of the value of it can be

842
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:23,700
to move the contents to the left to right top, bottom top,

843
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:26,736
right top left. Okay you could just move it, not stretch it

844
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:29,706
out but just move it to that place in the new bounce.

845
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:33,176
You can scale it. This is the default, ScaleToFill, okay?

846
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,578
And that's a stretching out behavior.

847
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,180
Or the holy grail, Redraw.

848
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:40,149
If you set your content mode to Redraw, it'll call your

849
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:44,887
drawRect again, okay? You often want that. Maybe most of

850
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:49,425
the time you want that, okay? All right, everybody got that?

851
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:52,595
We'll be doing this in the demo, too, so you'll see it.

852
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:54,530
Okay, so I'm not going to come back to this slide.

853
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,233
So, just tell you what's coming up after the demo.

854
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,003
No section on Friday, as we said. Next week, gestures,

855
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:03,439
multiple MVCs and View Controller Lifecycle, okay we

856
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,908
will talk about next week. And right now I'm going to do

857
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,745
at demo where I'm gonna do custom UI view to draw this

858
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:14,083
face thing, okay. That's the timer saying we should

859
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:20,556
start the demo. Let's do it. All right,

860
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:23,393
so I'm not going to be doing calculator here, this

861
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:26,629
is going to be a completely new application, alright,

862
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,599
so I'm going down here to create new XCode project.

863
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,769
Okay, here it is, it's still in iOS application though,

864
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,237
we'll do single view application.

865
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,007
I'm gonna call it, Faceit, okay? It's a face drawing

866
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,277
app so I'm ca-calling it Faceit. Make sure it's Swift,

867
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,312
not Objective-C and it'll be a universal

868
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,515
app cuz we're eventually gonna do multiple MVCs with

869
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:50,386
this thing too. No core date or testing, okay? We're going

870
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,855
to put it in the same place we put the calculator here, not

871
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,726
source code control yet. All right, so here's our new app,

872
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:59,362
I'm going to do the same thing I always do with this,

873
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,963
I called that images, that x, assets,

874
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,732
but it's called assets.xz assets.

875
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,934
This is where you would drag in your images if you wanted

876
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:08,104
to do that UI image named foo thing. You'll put them in

877
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:11,340
here, but, obviously, I don't need these things,

878
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:11,407
as usual, so

879
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,976
I'm just gonna group them into that supporting

880
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:16,412
files so they're not distracting you every time you

881
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,716
take a look over here on the left, cuz all we really care,

882
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,251
care about, again, is our storyboard and

883
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:25,054
our view controller. Now, again, we're talking about

884
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,556
view controller lifecycle next week, so

885
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,225
we're gonna delete these, all right? Now, the first

886
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,761
thing I'm gonna do is actually rename this ViewController,

887
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,030
because it gives me this [LAUGH] generic name,

888
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:37,366
ViewController, which we talked about last week, not so

889
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,603
good, okay? Well, I'm, I don't want that. I'm gonna,

890
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,206
I want mine to be called FaceViewController,

891
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,807
because it's gonna show a face.

892
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,943
So I could just say FaceViewController, and

893
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:50,113
I might think, okay, I'm good to go, FaceViewController. But

894
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:52,982
of course, that's not good enough. First of all,

895
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,885
I probably wanna rename the file, because in Swift,

896
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,455
generally the name of the file should be the name of the most

897
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:03,192
important class in the file, okay? Cuz that's what people

898
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:04,827
are gonna expect when they see the name of the file.

899
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,596
So that's one thing. But that's not enough,

900
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:10,166
either. Cuz if I go back here to my storyboard,

901
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,635
and I look at my view controller right here.

902
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:15,805
I can actually look at this inspector up here. If you pick

903
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,841
up your view controller and look at his one right here.

904
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,409
It's called the identity inspector.

905
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:23,813
I can actually see what the story board thinks the class

906
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:27,216
of this view controller is. And you can see that it thinks

907
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:31,554
it's view controller, okay. Generic view controller. And

908
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:34,357
of course I renamed so that's not what I want. So I can

909
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,959
change it though, just by clicking here and changing it

910
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,397
to face view controller, okay. So in your assignment to,

911
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,231
it's not a required task, but

912
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:46,469
I strongly recommend that you rename your view controller.

913
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,971
Assignment two is about the calculator. Rename it from

914
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,441
calc, from View Controller to be Calculator View Controller.

915
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:54,143
You will definitely want that for assignment three.

916
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,113
But I recommend doing it in assignment two. Okay, just so

917
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:58,748
you, this is all you have to do, what I just did.

918
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,750
It's not that hard, but it's good practice.

919
00:47:00,752 --> 00:47:03,753
Okay, it'll help you understand that the storyboard

920
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:07,423
has classes of things in its identity inspect, inspector

921
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:11,694
that have to match up with what's in your code, okay?

922
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,829
All right so

923
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:17,500
we got that renamed where we want to draw our face okay so

924
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:20,536
we need a face view a UI view a subclass of UI view it

925
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:23,506
does that. So let's create a subclass of UI view. Anytime

926
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:26,475
we're adding something to our project we go file new and

927
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:30,046
I'm gonna create a new file right here and this file's

928
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,583
gonna be iOS source. It's gonna be a Cocoa Touch Class,

929
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:36,419
cuz it's gonna be a subclass of UIView. Any time we create

930
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:39,589
a subclass of something in Cocoa Touch like UIView or

931
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:42,158
UIViewController or whatever, this is what we want.

932
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,061
So I'm gonna double-click that. Here it says subclass

933
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:48,631
of, it's already on UIView. But you can create subclasses

934
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,934
of NSObject, especially if you're doing Objective-C.

935
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,337
Or UIView controller or any of many, many,

936
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:58,107
many, many other classes. But we're gonna do UIView here.

937
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,376
I'm gonna call my view Faceview.

938
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,246
Okay, cuz that's what it is, a view that draws a face.

939
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,648
Okay, I'm gonna put it in the same group right here,

940
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,318
this group that has all this stuff in it. Okay, same thing.

941
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,054
We'll put it in there. And here it is.

942
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,990
Notice that it gave me a drawRect.

943
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:17,226
Look at that, drawRect. But it's commented out.

944
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,262
Now why did it give me a drawRect commented out?

945
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:22,632
And this is because unless your drawRect actually does

946
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:25,201
something, do not have a drawRect, because if

947
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:28,371
the systems sees that you have a UIB that has a drawRect,

948
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:31,908
it's gonna think that it needs to get you to draw itself all

949
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,877
the time. But if you don't actually draw anything,

950
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:35,645
maybe you just have subviews,

951
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:38,214
okay, you don't draw anything, then you don't want the system

952
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:41,784
wasting its time trying to get you to draw yourself, okay?

953
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:46,255
But of course, we are going to draw, so I'm gonna uncomment

954
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:50,326
out my drawRect here and start drawing my face.

955
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:56,866
Now my face is gonna look like we drew before here, okay?

956
00:48:56,868 --> 00:49:00,803
It's gonna be a rectangle and here's my bounds, let's say,

957
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:03,606
that I have to draw in. I'm gonna draw my face in

958
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:07,176
the middle, okay? It's gonna be the smaller of the width or

959
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:10,479
the height so the, its face fits completely, right? And

960
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:13,082
then I'm just gonna have a couple of round eyes and

961
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:15,117
a smiley face. And we're gonna make it so

962
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,886
this smile can be a smile or a frown or

963
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:18,521
it's movable basically, changeable.

964
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,123
Okay, so that's, that's what we're gonna build right here,

965
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,293
okay? So since I want this thing to be in the center, and

966
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,630
I want it to be the smaller of the width or the height so

967
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,967
it fits, I'm gonna create two vars to start off for

968
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:36,105
the center and this radius of this thing. So let's do that.

969
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,875
Okay, so let's, first let's do the radius here, so

970
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:41,877
I'm gonna say var. I'm inside my drawRect here,

971
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:45,314
just implement this. I'm gonna call this the skullRadius

972
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:49,652
cuz this is the radius of my face's skull, okay? And

973
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:55,825
I'm gonna make that equal to the minimum of the width or

974
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:59,395
the height of my view. Now what is the width or

975
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:02,565
the height of my view? Now there's different variables we

976
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:05,735
could look at here. We could look at this rect, okay?

977
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:10,339
I could say let width equal rect.size.width.

978
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:14,510
Would that be right? No, that would not be right,

979
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,879
because this rect is just an optimization

980
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:19,615
that says what part of the view to draw, okay?

981
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:23,019
Well, my face needs to kind of draw in the whole view or

982
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,321
won't be the right size, okay, it would be all small.

983
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:29,658
So this is not the right one. I could say frame.size.width.

984
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,063
Would that be right? No or yes?

985
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:38,167
No, I see a couple of shaking heads no. The answer is no.

986
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,137
Okay, frame is the rectangle that contains me in my

987
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,006
superviews coordinates. I'm drawing myself,

988
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,741
I can't draw in my superviews coordinates.

989
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:49,045
I need to draw in my coordinate system, okay? So

990
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:52,982
what we want here is bounds, okay. Bounds is the rectangle

991
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:56,185
that I'm drawing in in my coordinate system here,

992
00:50:56,187 --> 00:51:00,356
okay? Same thing height, bounds.size.height, okay?

993
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:01,824
And also I want my skull's radius,

994
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:06,429
I'm not doing the diameter. I want it to be divided by 2.

995
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:08,798
Now it's kinda silly to do these local variables.

996
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,400
Probably a lot better just to take this and copy and

997
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:16,005
paste these right in here like this. Okay,

998
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:19,141
let's make some more room here. All right, so

999
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:22,211
I've got the radius of my skull. That's good. What's

1000
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:25,281
the other thing I needed, is the center of my skull, so

1001
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:29,518
I'm gonna call that skullCenter. Okay, and

1002
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,690
what is the center? Well, can I say center? Is that good?

1003
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:38,427
No, center is my center in my superviews coordinates.

1004
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,831
That's where I am, okay, not the center. Now here's two

1005
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:45,101
interesting ways to get the actual center of my bounds.

1006
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:49,205
Okay, one is, believe it or not, is I can say,

1007
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:53,909
convertPoint. This is a UIView method, convertPoint,

1008
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:57,746
convert center, this point's center, from view,

1009
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:01,183
my superview, okay? [LAUGH] So I would be converting that

1010
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,953
point, the center, from my superviews coordinates to my

1011
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,622
coordinate system. This would be right. This would work,

1012
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,825
cuz now I'm in my coordinates system. Same point, but

1013
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:10,826
it's in my coordinate system.

1014
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,294
So that's one way we could do it.

1015
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,029
We probably wouldn't do it that way. Instead,

1016
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:18,334
we'd probably use some of the vars that are on CGRect. For

1017
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,570
example, I'd probably say something like

1018
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:26,442
the skull center is a CGPoint whose x, okay, x and

1019
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:30,913
y of CGPoint, right, whose x is probably my bounds.midX and

1020
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:36,986
my y is my bounds.midY. Okay, so midX is just a property

1021
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:40,890
on CGRect which tells you the x that's midway across this,

1022
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:45,261
the rectangle. Same thing midY. Okay, so

1023
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:48,264
I've got my radius and my center. I put these as vars,

1024
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,533
but really they probably wanna be lets,

1025
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,567
okay, cuz I'm, I've calculated,

1026
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:54,904
I'm not gonna change them after this. All right, so

1027
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:59,475
now that I have this, I need to create a Bezier path for

1028
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:02,578
my skull, for the circle here. So I'm just going to

1029
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,681
create a local variable here called skull. It's going to be

1030
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:10,286
of type UIBezierPath, and so UIBezierPath. And

1031
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:13,923
you can see UIBezierPath has a bunch of initializers here.

1032
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:16,859
I could use this one, ovalInRect, because a circle

1033
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:20,329
is an oval. But I'm gonna use this one arcCenter because

1034
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:25,201
I have the radius in center. I don't I don't wanna create

1035
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,335
an oval in my entire bound.

1036
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:29,505
I'd have to create just some kinda rectangle that gets my,

1037
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:32,441
only my skull. So I'm gonna use this one, arcCenter, which

1038
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:35,477
takes a radius and a center, which I have right here.

1039
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:38,547
And then a start angle and an end angle as it goes around

1040
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:42,151
the arc, and either clockwise or counterclockwise. Okay, so

1041
00:53:42,153 --> 00:53:46,422
let's do that. So what is the center of my arc? skullCenter,

1042
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,625
okay, that's the center of this arc I'm gonna draw that's

1043
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:53,395
gonna be my skull. The radius is the skullRadius, right,

1044
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,664
that's the radius I'm going around.

1045
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:59,802
Now startAngle to endAngle, that's in radians.

1046
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:00,903
Does everyone know what radians?

1047
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:04,707
Raise your hands if you know what radians are. Okay,

1048
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,342
almost everybody, good. So radians,

1049
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:09,845
0 to 2pi radians to go all the way around the circle.

1050
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:14,350
So I'm gonna go from 0 to *_PI, okay.

1051
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:16,852
And then I can either go clockwise around or I can go

1052
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:19,688
counterclockwise. In this case I'm going all the way around,

1053
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,058
so it doesn't matter. So I'll just go counterclockwise,

1054
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,930
whatever, okay? So you can see how this has drawn an arc, so

1055
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,798
I've create a Bezier path which the path

1056
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,402
is around a circle, okay? Now well, I have an error here?

1057
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,137
What's, what do you think this error right here is?

1058
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:38,774
Look at that. Cannot convert value of type 'Double'

1059
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,776
to expected argument type 'CGFloat'.

1060
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,812
It's pointing to this little thing right here, this _PI,

1061
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:45,648
okay? Well, this is what I was telling you about before.

1062
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:52,621
All these drawing things are in CGFloat. What type is this?

1063
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,057
What type is that expression? >> Double?

1064
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,058
>> It's a double, right. Okay,

1065
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,861
so we can't use a double there. It has to be a CGFloat.

1066
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:02,564
So we have to convert it to a CGFloat by doing this,

1067
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:06,969
okay, CGFloat. Now how come this is not complaining?

1068
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,706
Okay, I told you last time that if you see a literal 0.0,

1069
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:15,177
it thinks that's a double. Didn't I tell you that? Well,

1070
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,647
I lied. Because when it sees 0.0, it can convert it to

1071
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:22,017
a number of different types, since it's a literal.

1072
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,220
Okay, Swift can only do this automatic typing version for

1073
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,990
literals, okay? So 0.0 is a literal, so

1074
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,725
it can convert to a number of different types.

1075
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:34,596
Double, Float, CGFloat. It knows how to do that, okay?

1076
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,732
So why does it pick CGFloat here?

1077
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:41,036
Because it knows this method takes a CGFloat. And when

1078
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,073
it sees a literal and it sees CGFloat is the argument type,

1079
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:46,408
it tries to convert it to a CGFloat if it can.

1080
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:52,081
Which it can, okay? Everybody got that? All right,

1081
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,717
so I have this skull. It's of type UIBezierPath.

1082
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,919
I can set attributes on this skull now,

1083
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,723
like maybe it's Line with maybe we'll make it 5.0 point

1084
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:05,027
that's 5.0 points wide. Right? If I wanna set a color,

1085
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,930
I don't say skull set color something like that.

1086
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:12,334
I create the color I want. So let's make our skull be blue

1087
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:15,070
okay? So blueColor, which is the type method on UIColor.

1088
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:19,908
And I'm gonna say set. There's setFill, there's setStroke,

1089
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,579
and there's also set, which sets both the fill and

1090
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:26,448
the stroke. Okay? Now,

1091
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,486
to get it to draw, I just need to say skull.stroke, okay,

1092
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:35,023
and that's going to draw along this Arc, then I drew with

1093
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:39,361
this line width and with the color that set. Okay, that's

1094
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:44,032
all that's necessary to draw the skull of our face here.

1095
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,335
So, now we have this nice UIView, this custom UIView.

1096
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:49,938
It draws the skull of a face anyway. How do we get it into

1097
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,642
our UI? So if we go back to out storyboard over here.

1098
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,011
Right now it's blank. There's nothing in here.

1099
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:58,380
There's only this background view.

1100
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:01,250
And I promised you that there was a Var in

1101
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:05,087
the Faceview controller that pointed to this view.

1102
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,990
And I'm going to show it to you by right clicking on this.

1103
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,993
You see it right here? When I mouse over it you see how it's

1104
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:15,998
highlighting it? This is a outlet called View, just like

1105
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,833
you have an outlet on your display on your calculator,

1106
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:22,671
this one is an outlet or var, which is a type UI view and

1107
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,740
it's connected to this thing right here so

1108
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:25,674
it's automatically connected up for

1109
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:28,844
you., you don't even need to control, drag it or anything,

1110
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:31,513
okay? But we're not gonna be adding our viewing code, so

1111
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:32,614
we don't really need that var,

1112
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,816
I just wanted to show you it was there.

1113
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:36,552
I'm going to add my view by dragging it out. And if I

1114
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:39,388
go down here to my palette, obviously I'm not gonna find

1115
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:42,291
face view in here. Okay. IOS didn't know

1116
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:45,828
about face view when it built Xcode. But I can go down to

1117
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,031
the very bottom here and grab one of these. Okay?

1118
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:53,101
This is a generic UI view Okay not a sub class of UI view

1119
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:57,039
just the UI view. So I'm gonna drag it out and put it here.

1120
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,641
Now I'm gonna do a cool thing okay I'm trying to show you

1121
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,744
bit by bit a little more of this constraints thing so

1122
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:05,948
I'm gonna take this thing I'm gonna us the blue lines okay.

1123
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:09,184
I'm gonna put it all the way up in the corner here and

1124
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:12,020
then I'm gonna put the other edge all the way down in

1125
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,723
the corner down here and I'm using blue lines you see blue

1126
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:18,961
lines? Appearing. Those blue lines are making this thing

1127
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,930
attach to well known point. In this case, the edges.

1128
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:25,734
So I want my face view to fill the entire view, okay?

1129
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:29,938
The entire view controller's view. All right, but just

1130
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,841
doing the blue lines isn't enough as we learned, okay?

1131
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,477
That's just kind of telling the system what you intend.

1132
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:38,580
To make it do it you actually have to have constraints like

1133
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:39,715
those things we control drag.

1134
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:42,451
So I could try and control drag to an edge, control down

1135
00:58:42,453 --> 00:58:45,921
to this edge, all that, but there's an easier way. If you

1136
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:49,791
did all blue lines and that's all you needed, you could

1137
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:53,161
go down here to the same place where you update frames and

1138
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:57,933
instead do Reset to Suggested Constraints. And that will

1139
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:02,504
use the blue lines to put some suggestive constraints. Now,

1140
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:05,641
let's see what it did. You can see all the constraints on

1141
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:08,210
a view by going over to the inspector and

1142
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:12,347
going to this tab right here, which is the size inspector.

1143
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,850
And if you look in the size inspector, down toward

1144
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:18,954
the bottom, you can see constraints. You see them? And

1145
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:20,589
this is showing me all the constraints and

1146
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:23,825
it put one trailing, that looks good. Leading yeah,

1147
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:28,564
top nice, bottom perfect. So it put exactly the constraints

1148
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:33,168
I want because it followed the blue lines okay so now I have

1149
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,071
this view constrained to stick to the edges.

1150
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,273
Perfect, because then when I go landscape or

1151
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:42,344
portrait my bounds are constantly being resized.

1152
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:45,314
To fit the new shape. Okay? Now

1153
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:48,951
the other thing I need to do is this is a generic UI view.

1154
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:49,384
If I ran right now,

1155
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:52,087
it would come up blank because it has no draw rects.

1156
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:55,691
Okay? I did that nice face view draw rect but this is not

1157
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:58,293
a face view. So how do I set this to be a face view?

1158
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:02,331
Exactly the same way that I set this view controller to be

1159
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:06,201
a face view controller. I go to the identity inspector and

1160
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:09,504
instead of, so here is when I did the controller, I click on

1161
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:13,041
this view and instead of it being a generic UI view,

1162
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:17,279
you see, I change it to be face view.

1163
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:21,183
Got it? Okay. So let's run, okay it should work,

1164
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:23,986
let's run on Iphone six, for example. And

1165
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:29,491
hopefully, we'll get the skull of our face to draw.

1166
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:36,632
Perfect it worked okay.

1167
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:39,735
So here's our skull it picked the smaller of the width or

1168
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:40,669
the height they went to smaller so

1169
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,805
picked is drawing the whole side, if I rotate? Uh-oh.

1170
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:47,976
Stretch-a-roo. Okay? So that's this problem with the content

1171
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:52,447
mode of our face view is set to be scaled to fill. Okay, so

1172
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:53,515
it's scaling our thing.

1173
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,318
So we don't want that. So let's go back here and

1174
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,588
go to storyboard and select out face view right here,

1175
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,789
go to the attributes inspector.

1176
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:04,026
The very first thing is the content mode. And you can see

1177
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:07,162
it is scale to fill, and i want it to be redraw.

1178
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,998
In other words when my bounds change, call my draw rect.

1179
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,240
You see that? Okay here we go,

1180
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:22,177
works in landscape works in portrait. Okay,

1181
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,981
it's even switching from using the width to the height.

1182
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:27,883
>> Because that gets smaller.

1183
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:31,219
>> Okay, sound good.

1184
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,455
Now one thing that's kind of a bummer.

1185
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:37,726
Here in my interface builder, I don't see my face.

1186
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,796
How come I don't see my face here? And it is possible to

1187
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,267
make the face appear here, and we'll do that next week, okay?

1188
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:47,402
Cuz it's nice, when you're building your storyboard,

1189
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:51,173
to be able to see your custom views in there. All right, so

1190
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,008
let's go back to our face view and add some more.

1191
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,945
Let's add some eyes. We'll add some eyes to, our face,

1192
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:59,848
here, and to do that, I'm gonna start having some little

1193
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,650
helper functions here along the way.

1194
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:06,788
I'm gonna make it so that my eyes and

1195
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,258
the mouth are all relative to the size of my skull,

1196
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,293
what ever my skull size is,

1197
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:14,629
I'm gonna make everything else relative to it obviously. So

1198
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,665
I'm gonna take this skull center and radius, and

1199
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:21,169
take them out of drawrect and make them vars, okay.

1200
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:24,740
These are gonna be vars. Now when I tried to do this, and

1201
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:27,309
you'll try this in your homework I'm sure.

1202
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:28,210
You're gonna get this error.

1203
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:32,013
It stays instance member bounds, okay? Is,

1204
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:34,750
cannot be used in type face view. And you are gonna get so

1205
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:38,587
frustrated, cuz you're gonna say bounds is definitely

1206
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:39,654
an instance member of face view,

1207
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:43,425
how come I can't use it here? Okay? And the answer

1208
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:47,529
of why you can't use it here is because you are in

1209
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:52,134
the initialization phase. You are initializing this. And

1210
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:56,471
during initialization, you cannot use your class.

1211
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:59,307
It's not initialized yet. So you can't call vars and

1212
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:04,513
methods like bounds. Okay? Everyone understand that?

1213
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:08,049
So, you will see this message I'm sure. And you will post on

1214
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:10,352
PL as a Piazza probably and say, what's going on? But

1215
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,087
I'm telling you right now what's going on.

1216
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,055
During an initialization you cannot,

1217
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,157
until you're fully initialized,

1218
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,659
you can't access your own properties. So,

1219
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:18,760
what are we going to do here about this?

1220
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:22,330
Well, I'm just going to change this to be calculated. Okay?

1221
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:26,201
To be a computed property. Okay. I'm gonna just return

1222
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:31,072
this value right here. Okay. Now, two things about computer

1223
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:35,043
properties. Notice that I didn't say get},

1224
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:39,681
If you have a computer property that only gets,

1225
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:42,918
you do not need to put together in there. Okay.

1226
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,388
And we never would. Look much nicer not to put it.

1227
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,790
Same thing here, this is a CGPoint.

1228
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:54,429
We're going to return this. Okay,

1229
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:59,000
not gonna put the get in there. All right,

1230
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:03,605
that make sense? Now one other thing I wanna do is,

1231
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:08,777
my skull is all the way out to the edge. I'd like my skull to

1232
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:12,747
be able to be kinda scalable, to be smaller than the edge.

1233
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:16,184
So I'm gonna add a public var called scale, okay,

1234
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,119
which is going to be a CGFloat.

1235
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:22,123
And it's going to scale my skull. And I'm just gonna do

1236
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,226
that by here when I'm calculating the radius,

1237
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:27,529
I'm just gonna multiply it by my scale. And

1238
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:28,997
I'm gonna set it to 90% so

1239
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:32,100
that my skull's kinda 90% of all the way in.

1240
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,002
Now I'm gonna use these two vars, okay,

1241
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:37,172
these computed vars, in all my other calculation. Eyes and

1242
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,941
mouth, all these things, I'm gonna use the same thing. So

1243
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:43,411
we'll do eyes today, and then mouth, we'll either do mouth

1244
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,081
at the start of next lecture, or maybe I'll just post,

1245
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:49,651
I'm gonna post this code, by the way, on Piazza afterwards.

1246
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:51,086
Maybe I'll just post the mouth code so

1247
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:55,156
you can take a look at it. But let's do these eyes first.

1248
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:58,193
How do we do the eyes? To do the eyes,

1249
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:02,497
I need kind of the ratio between the skull radius and

1250
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:05,400
the eye size. So to make things quick, I actually am

1251
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,036
gonna type those in real fast, here they are. Okay, so

1252
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:11,072
here's all the ratios from the skull's radius to the eye's

1253
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,743
offset to the eye's radius to the mouth's width, height, and

1254
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:18,914
offset, etc. Notice how we do constants in Swift.

1255
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:24,552
We create structs and then we have type variables, static.

1256
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:27,956
Type variables, okay, which are lets. They're typed like

1257
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:33,328
this too. That has the value, okay? So this is how we do it.

1258
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,663
Notice these are capitalized and

1259
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:37,399
of course as the name of a type we always capitalize

1260
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:39,334
the names of types. Don't forget that.

1261
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:42,103
Okay, some of you don't like to do that. Please do it.

1262
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,606
In Swift we capitalize all type names. And

1263
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:48,443
we also capitalize these, okay, these static things that

1264
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,612
are basically constants in this struct.

1265
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,348
And I'll show you, we're gonna access these by saying Ratios

1266
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,718
dot this, okay, cuz this is the name of the type.

1267
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,821
This is the, the value in it. So I'll show you that when we

1268
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:03,591
start using these. So how am I gonna do this?

1269
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:06,494
How am I gonna make my eye here? I'm gonna create a new

1270
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:09,965
method here. First of all, let me create a little type here,

1271
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:13,068
which is an enum. I'm gonna call it eye. It's gonna have

1272
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:18,139
left eye and right eye. That's just so I can talk about my

1273
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:23,278
eyes in my API. And then I'm gonna have a func,

1274
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,883
which I'm gonna call pathForCircleCenteredAtPoint,

1275
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:33,621
okay? It's going to take a midpoint, which is a CGPoint.

1276
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:38,293
And I'm gonna have withRadius, which is gonna be a CGFloat.

1277
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:42,831
And it's gonna return a UIBezierPath. So

1278
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,199
this is gonna be a utility function,

1279
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:47,936
okay? It's private actually, make sure we get this private.

1280
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,238
And this is private also.

1281
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,641
Okay, these two are actually private. I'm gonna try and

1282
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:57,946
get in the habit of actually putting my privates in here so

1283
01:06:57,948 --> 01:07:00,382
that we get the, our things proper.

1284
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:05,120
This is properly public, okay? So this function is just going

1285
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:08,690
to take a center point and a radius and give us a Bezier

1286
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,859
path, exactly the same thing we're doing here. So

1287
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:14,362
I'm actually even just gonna copy this, cut it actually,

1288
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:19,467
and put it here. Okay, so we got that.

1289
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:20,935
And the center is not the skullCenter,

1290
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:24,506
it's the midPoint. And the radius is not the skullRadius,

1291
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:28,076
it's this withRadius. Now let's just kind of point out

1292
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:31,379
this weirdness of having something that reads nice when

1293
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:35,116
you call it, because when I call this down here I'm gonna

1294
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:37,619
say pathForCircle with CenteredAtPoint,

1295
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:40,955
the skull's center, withRadius the skull's radius.

1296
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:44,092
That reads really nicely, like English. Okay, got this nice

1297
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:47,062
preposition in here. But when I'm inside my code,

1298
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:50,265
it's kind of weird that this is called my withRadius.

1299
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:52,200
Okay, that doesn't really make sense.

1300
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:54,869
I really want this to be called radius inside.

1301
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:57,038
So this is where I'm gonna have the internal name and

1302
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,610
the external name that we talked about. See that? Okay,

1303
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:06,247
so that's all that this is gonna do. I'm not gonna return

1304
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:09,084
it directly though. I'm gonna let the path equal this and

1305
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,886
then I'm going to use this to set my lineWidth as well.

1306
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:15,023
In fact, let's just cut and paste this as well up here.

1307
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:19,861
So I'm gonna have all my lineWidths be the same. Okay,

1308
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,764
this is probably something I want to make a var out of,

1309
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,431
just like I have the scale,

1310
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,967
probably want the lineWidth also to be settable, but for

1311
01:08:25,969 --> 01:08:28,636
speed we'll keep going here. And then we're gonna return

1312
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:33,808
that path. Okay, got that? Make sense? By the way,

1313
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,778
when we have a really long line right here that wraps,

1314
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:40,081
one way that we can kind of make it look nicer is just put

1315
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:46,154
every argument on its own line. Like that,

1316
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:49,090
okay? Just a little more readable that way when it's

1317
01:08:49,092 --> 01:08:51,192
really long. So I've got this right here, and

1318
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:54,329
I've replaced this skull thing with this, okay? By the way,

1319
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:57,765
I don't really use skull, except for to do this stroke.

1320
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:04,038
So let's take this, cut it out of here, and put it here,

1321
01:09:05,075 --> 01:09:08,710
okay? Everyone see what I did there?

1322
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:13,314
I'm just chaining calling this and then calling stroke on it.

1323
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,483
And it's pretty obvious this is my skull,

1324
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,252
because I got skullCenter, skullRadius.

1325
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:20,155
Okay, so now I have this path for circle, I can use that to

1326
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:23,591
draw my eyes as well. So I'm gonna add another private func

1327
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:26,995
here called get eye, what did we call it, pathForEye,

1328
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,730
pathForEye and it's gonna take an eye,

1329
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:33,168
which is of type Eye and it's gonna return a UIBezierPath.

1330
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,737
Okay, so this is gonna get an eye, either the left eye or

1331
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:37,839
the right eye depending on what this argument here is

1332
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:42,777
right here. And to do that I need the eyeRadius.

1333
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,179
So we'll have the eyeRadius,

1334
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,248
which is going to be equal to the skull's radius,

1335
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,518
divided by one of these ratios up here, okay, in fact,

1336
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:56,357
this ratio right here. So we'll say Ratio., Ratios.,

1337
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:01,062
this one is SkullRadiusToEyeRadius, okay?

1338
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:05,800
And then I'm gonna let the eyeCenter equal the I'm gonna

1339
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:09,571
actually call a function here, getEyeCenter for

1340
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:12,540
the given eye. Okay, and so let's do that.

1341
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:17,679
Private func, getEyeCenter for given eye. And

1342
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:22,116
that's gonna return a CGPoint which is gonna be the center.

1343
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:26,721
All right, so how do I get the eyes centered here?

1344
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:31,726
That's pretty straightforward. Here I'm just going to say,

1345
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,596
what did I decide to do here on that one? Yeah, so

1346
01:10:34,598 --> 01:10:39,667
I'm gonna let the eyeOffset = skullRadius

1347
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:43,738
/ Ratios.SkullRadiusToEyeOffset.

1348
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,708
Okay, so I'm just, see how I'm just doing all the positioning

1349
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,943
of everything based on the skullRadius and

1350
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,778
the skullCenter? So

1351
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:54,182
then I'm gonna let the eyeCenter = skullCenter.

1352
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:56,651
So we'll start with the eye being right in the middle

1353
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:59,053
of our face, and then I'm gonna move it up and over,

1354
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:03,558
right? So first of all let's move it up by saying that

1355
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:09,130
the eyeCenter.y -= because y minus is up, plus is down for

1356
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:13,468
the y-axis, the y offset. So I'm gonna move it up by the y

1357
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:18,673
offset. And then depending on which eye it is, okay, if it's

1358
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:23,544
the left eye I'm gonna move the eyeOffset.x to the left,

1359
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:27,382
okay, minus, oops, this is eyeCenter. And actually

1360
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:30,451
this should be eyeCenter also. We're gonna move the eyeCenter

1361
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,087
to the left to by the eyeOffset.

1362
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,555
And if it's the right eye,

1363
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:40,361
then I'm gonna move the eye to the right by the eyeOffset.

1364
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:45,700
Okay, so that tells where our eye is. So I'm gonna return

1365
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:50,571
the eyeCenter here. Okay, everyone got that, where the,

1366
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:54,876
where the eye is? So we have a warning here, what is it?

1367
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:59,614
Let var, okay, so this needs to be var Or no, this needs to

1368
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:03,217
be a var, I guess. This needs to be a let, okay, and

1369
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:06,988
the lets and vars are right, yes. Okay, so here we're gonna

1370
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,090
get the center of the eye using that function, so

1371
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:12,727
we have the radius and the center, for the eye. So,

1372
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:18,399
now we can just return, return a path for

1373
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:23,237
a circle centered at point, the eyeCenter withRadius

1374
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:28,209
the eyeRadius. Okay, so we have this

1375
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:31,212
path for eye, now we just need to stroke this path. So we're

1376
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:37,218
gonna say pathForEye, for eye, let's do the left eye.

1377
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,923
And stroke that. And then path for I. Lets' do the right I,

1378
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:45,026
and stroke that, okay? Notice, by they way,

1379
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,863
I can say .left here. I don't have to say i.left.because

1380
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:53,601
it's going infer that path for I is going to be an I,

1381
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:57,038
okay? Everybody got that? Success?

1382
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,943
So hopefully now when we draw we'll get some eyes on our

1383
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:06,614
face. Didn't quite work,

1384
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:09,984
okay? So, let's close what happened there.

1385
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:11,853
We got one eye, the left eye looks good, but

1386
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:16,023
the right eye is kind of stuck in the center. So why is that?

1387
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:19,293
Let's look here, well, looks to me like I moved the, for

1388
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:23,631
the right eye, I moved the center y back to this,

1389
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,233
where it was before, see I moved there, so

1390
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:32,573
this really needs to be the x, see that? It's over on that.

1391
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:36,778
Okay, bingo. Got a face,

1392
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,747
can rotate him, it's looking good. So now we did the mouth,

1393
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,984
okay, let's see if we have time for the mouth, yeah,

1394
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:45,486
we might, we'll get started on the mouth anyway. So

1395
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:48,322
here I'm doing the same thing, private funk, path for

1396
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:51,292
mouth this time, okay, there's only one mouth, and

1397
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:55,229
it's going to return UI Bezier Path okay,

1398
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:57,799
and then we're gonna do the same thing down here.

1399
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:00,802
We're gonna say pathForMouth().stroke.

1400
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:01,969
Okay, so how are we gonna do the mouth?

1401
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:05,273
I'm gonna have to use a bezier curve to do the mouth.

1402
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,108
How many people know what a bezier curve is?

1403
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,377
Raise your hand if you know. Almost nobody. Okay, So

1404
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:12,580
Bayesian curve is just a line you draw between two points,

1405
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:15,383
but you have two control points somewhere, where,

1406
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:20,254
it tries to draw a tangent line to the control point and

1407
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:20,988
start the curve on there.

1408
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:23,558
And then draw the tangent line to the other control point and

1409
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,828
tries to draw another one there, so you can make curves

1410
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,329
Okay, using these little control points.

1411
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,598
So I have to determine the start and the end, and

1412
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,532
the two control points.

1413
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:35,470
So first I'm gonna create a rectangle to contain my mouth

1414
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:40,208
here. I need these mouth ratios, so the mouth width,

1415
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,044
height, and offset, I'm gonna make as ratios to the skull

1416
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:46,280
radius, okay? Save a little time by doing that. And

1417
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:51,919
then I'm gonna make the The rectangle changes them out by

1418
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:58,726
equal a and this I'm going to use the X,

1419
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:03,431
Y width height intizler here. So

1420
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:08,503
the X is just the center. .x- mouthWidth/2,

1421
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:12,840
okay? So my mouth is going to be whatever the mouthWidth is

1422
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:17,712
from the skullCenter. Move it over. And the y is similarly

1423
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,848
going to be the skullCenter.y +,

1424
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:25,119
actually The mouth off set, because we're going to put

1425
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:27,054
the mouth down below the center of the face, so

1426
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:30,491
we're going to do it down. The width is just the mouth width,

1427
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:33,861
and the height is the mouth height, okay, and just to show

1428
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,731
you what this is like, I'm going to create a rectangle,

1429
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:40,768
UI Bezier Path has a constructor which creates

1430
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:45,339
a rectangle using mouth rect. Okay, so let's run that,

1431
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:50,478
let's return that actually. Okay, that's the path

1432
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,580
we're going to use, we're just going to do a rectangle first,

1433
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:58,019
I'm not going to do those control point things yet. So

1434
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,353
our rect is going to be a rectangle, so

1435
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,222
this is where we're going to do the mouth, if it's smiling,

1436
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,891
it will be down here, if it's frowning, the mouth is going

1437
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:06,494
to be up here. Okay, so we are going to put this here.

1438
01:16:06,496 --> 01:16:09,864
This is going to be the start point of my busy path.

1439
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:10,798
This is going to be the end point.

1440
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,668
I'm going to put one control point here and one control

1441
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:16,337
point here for a full smile. And so it going to start

1442
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:19,774
heading down towards this control point bottom out. And

1443
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:22,510
then start heading towards the tangent line between here and

1444
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:25,546
this one. So, that's what is going to make a smile. Okay?

1445
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:29,183
Don't worry about it too much if you don't know Bézier path.

1446
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:29,984
So here, I also,

1447
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:33,254
I'm gonna type this in really fast just to save

1448
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:37,291
some time here. Most important thing is this mouth curvature.

1449
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:40,661
This is just a double, which is somewhere between -1,

1450
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:44,265
which is a full front, and 1, which is a full smile.

1451
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:48,235
Okay and so the smile offset, first I'm gonna make sure

1452
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:51,739
it s between one and

1453
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:55,309
going to be that one to minus one times the mouth's height.

1454
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,945
That's why I'm going to put my control point all that way day

1455
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:03,184
at the bottom if the smile is one All right, so here so

1456
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,020
here I'm gonna start at the mouth's upper left. I'm gonna

1457
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:09,256
end at mouth upper right, okay? My first control point

1458
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,593
is a third of the way along the bottom. And the second

1459
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:16,197
control is a third of the way on the other side, okay?

1460
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:19,033
And on the bottom, wherever the smileOffset

1461
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,469
puts it. Okay, so in full smile this is gonna be along

1462
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:25,306
the bottom of the Rect. Could be up above the rack. Okay, so

1463
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,776
I've got that so now I'm just gonna return UIBEzier path

1464
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,078
here that incorporates all that.

1465
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:36,317
Let's actually do this let's say let UIBEzier path. I'm

1466
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:41,255
just gonna create a blank one then I'm gonna tell the path

1467
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:44,258
that to move to the start. Move to our starting point

1468
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:48,262
which is start, that's this thing right here. Okay then

1469
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:51,632
I'm gonna create a bezierPath or bezierCurve which is add

1470
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:55,403
curve to point that's the way you add a bezierCurve

1471
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:58,839
to a path it goes to the end point which is this right

1472
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:03,878
here, and here's my 2 control points cp1 and cp2.

1473
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:08,082
Okay, that's these two guys. All right, so I've done that.

1474
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:11,252
I'm gonna set the line width equal to 5.0 and

1475
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:16,190
return the path. Okay? So let's see if that works,

1476
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,527
we have our mouth here set to be 0, which is not a smile or

1477
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:22,763
a frown, it should be just kind of straight line Cuz our

1478
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:25,833
control points are gonna be right along the line sure

1479
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:29,804
enough this is not a very happy camper let's make them

1480
01:18:29,806 --> 01:18:30,971
very sad.

1481
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:42,149
Okay aw that looks very sad but I don't you saying I don't

1482
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,784
wanna sending you guys out of here sad so

1483
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:52,259
we're gonna go to full happy here. There it is. Very happy.

1484
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,562
Okay. Now, one thing I'm gonna do, last thing I'm gonna do

1485
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:57,598
before we leave is this mouth curvature is currently a local

1486
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,267
variable inside this private method. I'm actually gonna

1487
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:04,038
make this public. Okay, so I'm just gonna take it out of here

1488
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,741
I put my public bars up here at the front,

1489
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:09,677
loose scale. Put it there, I'm gonna make it a var so

1490
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,347
it's public. So now other people using my face view can

1491
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:17,184
set how happy it is, right? Cuz I've made this public so

1492
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:18,252
they can set whether it's a smile or

1493
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,322
a frown. And that's gonna be really valuable next week when

1494
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:24,658
we stat having multiple NVCs cuz we're gonna wanna be able

1495
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,161
to use other NVCs to show things,

1496
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,930
okay? So just to show this still works,

1497
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:35,970
the mouth curvature is still a full smile. There we go.

1498
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:39,006
Okay we'll pick this up next week.

1499
