[SOUND] Stanford University. >> All right well welcome
斯坦福大学

2
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:13,212
to Stanford CS193P. This is Spring of 2016 version and
欢迎来到 2016 年春季的斯坦福 CS193P 课程

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:16,982
today I'm gonna give you a real quick explanation of what
今天我会快速阐述一下这门课是关于什么的

4
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,986
this class is to make sure you're in the right place. I'm
以免你们来错了地方

5
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,722
gonna talk about prerequisites cuz it's super important to be
也会介绍一下参加这门课程的前提

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,159
successful in this class to have the prerequisites.
要想上好这门课，有些准备还是很重要的

7
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,129
Then I'm just gonna give you the briefest overview of what
接着我会介绍一下 iOS 是什么

8
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:34,466
iOS is. Most of you know because you have iPhones or
你们应该都知道

9
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,300
iPads or something like that, so
因为你们用过 iPhone 或者 iPad

10
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,037
I'm not gonna waste a lot of time talking about that. And
我不会在介绍 iOS 上浪费很多时间

11
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,206
then finally I'm gonna dive right into a big demo that's
最后我会带你们做一个大一点的 demo

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,475
gonna build our first application. Cuz I really
直接开始打造我们的第一个应用程序

13
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,411
don't believe in wasting a lot of time with overhead.
因为我不太想花太多时间讲一些理论的知识

14
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,513
We're just gonna dive right in and start learning how to do
我们就直接开始上手做一些东西

15
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:51,984
this stuff, okay? We only have ten weeks to learn iOS. That's
因为我们的课程只有 10 周

16
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,753
a short amount of time for it. It's a very powerful system.
对于一个这么强大的系统来说，这点学习时间太短了

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:59,158
So we're gonna have to really go at break neck speed. So
所以需要以飞快的速度进行学习

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,292
what will you learn in this class?
在这门课程中你将学到什么？

19
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,561
You're gonna learn to build cool apps, all right.
你将会学到如何打造很酷的 App

20
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,064
iOS apps are cool. Why are they cool?
iOS App 很酷，为什么呢？

21
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,466
Well, they're cool because they sit in your pocket, and
因为它们就在你的口袋里

22
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,468
you can bring it out and show your friends.
你可以直接拿出来给你的朋友们看

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,171
They're cool because they're really easy to distribute.
还有就是，App 很容易被发布

24
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:12,304
If you build an app,
如果你开发了一款应用

25
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,040
you can put it on the app store with no work. Boom,
你可以很轻松地把它放到 App Store 上

26
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:19,078
ship it out to your customers. And also it's a very vibrant,
通过 App Store 把它移交给你的顾客

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,448
community. All right? A lot of people doing iOS development,
iOS 开发的社区也很活跃

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,416
and they're very excited about it.
很多人在做 iOS 开发，并且他们也很热爱

29
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,320
And, also the apps that you build have animation, a lot of
App 也会包含一些很酷的动画

30
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,323
really cool interactions with users, so they're fun apps to
和用户之间很炫的交互

31
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,725
build. Okay, so you probably know all that,
所以制作 App 是很有趣的

32
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,161
that's why you're here. Another thing you're gonna
你们都知道这一点，这也是你们为什么来到这里的原因

33
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,197
learn though and you're gonna get out of this class
你们还会从这门课中学到

34
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,899
is real-life object-oriented programming.
面向对象编程的知识

35
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,569
iOS is entirely object-oriented in its design.
iOS 在设计上是完全面向对象的

36
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,505
All the writing of code you have to do is object-oriented
你们写的每一行代码都会是面向对象的

37
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,141
programming. And you're really gonna get the experience of
你们将会从现实的面向对象编程中

38
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,444
building a real-world thing using object-oriented
获得很多经验

39
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,481
programming which is a great programming paradigm. And
面向对象编程也是一个很好的编程范式

40
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,282
some of the things your going to learn for example using
你们将会使用

41
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,085
object-oriented programming. Object-oriented databases,
面向对象的数据库

42
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,521
were going to do graphics with object oriented programming.
使用面向对象来编写界面

43
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,790
Obviously going to be some multimedia stuff,
而且还会有一些关于多媒体的东西，

44
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,959
multi threading, animation, networking.
多线程、动画、网络等

45
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,927
All kinds of stuff that you're learning in your other
你们从其它 CS 课程中学到的知识

46
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,163
computer science classes, you're going to do for
都会在这门课程中

47
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,065
real, real life here in this class. So
得到真实的应用

48
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,734
that's really good, it's kind of a good synthesis class or
这很好，这就像一门综合的课程

49
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,570
practical synthesis class for all that stuff.
来运用你学所学到的知识

50
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:22,908
The prerequisites are really important in this class.
这门课的前提非常重要

51
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,110
The main one is object-oriented programming.
最主要的一个是面向对象编程

52
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,746
I really don't have time in ten weeks to take the time to
我不会在这 10 周中花时间教你们

53
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,015
teach you object-oriented programming first, so
如何使用面向对象编程

54
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,851
you really need to know that coming in. So in terms of
你们需要知道在这门课中会用到

55
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:37,890
Stanford's prerequisites that means CS106A&B or CS106X.
所以在学这门课之前需要先学习 CS106A&B 或 CS106X

56
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,259
That's absolutely required okay, so you get some
这是必须要有的前提

57
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,062
Java experience in there and a little bit of object-oriented.
所以我假定你们现在有了一些 Java 的编程经验和一些面向对象的基础

58
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,399
And then really important to take some,
在上这门课这之前

59
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,202
just some class where you're gonna do a lot of programming.
上过一些写了很多代码的课程也是很重要的

60
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:53,305
Okay like CS107 which is not hugely object-oriented but
例如 CS107，虽然没有大量关于面向对象的东西

61
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,273
there's a lot of programming.
但是上那门课会写很多代码

62
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:58,043
CS108 which is an awesome prerequisite for this class.
如果你在参加这门课之前上过 CS108 是非常好的

63
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,912
Okay, that's basically object-oriented Programming.
它讲是关于面向对象编程的东西

64
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,548
So if you've taken CS108, you're gonna be well prepared
所以如果你上过 CS108，你就已经准备好上这门课了

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,551
for this class. CS110, again, not really object oriented
CS110，同样也没有太多关于面向对象的知识

66
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,553
per-se, but there's a lot of coding in there.
但同样是一门非常好的编程课程，因为其中有大量的编程实践

67
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,189
You know, preferably you've taken some other CS classes,
你最好还上过其它的一些 CS 课程

68
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,925
you've written a lot of code because, let me warn you,
写过很多代码

69
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:16,728
this class is a lot of coding. All your assignments are all
因为上这门课需要写很多代码

70
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,731
coding. You're gonna write a ton of code in this class.
所有的作业都是写代码，你会在这门课中写大量的代码

71
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,267
So if you're not comfortable writing a ton of code,
所以如果你真的不太适应写比较多的代码

72
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,703
then this class is going to be a lot of work for you.
那么这门课程对你来说将是一个挑战

73
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,639
You're gonna find it, maybe you'll be a little underwater.
你会慢慢发现的

74
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,677
Okay so be prepared for a lot of coding.
所以做好要写很多代码的准备

75
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,779
When it comes to object-oriented programming,
当谈到面向对象编程

76
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,515
you should know all these terms like the back of your
你就应该像了解你的手背一样了解这些术语

77
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,616
hand. You shouldn't be looking at those and
你不应该连一些类似

78
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,652
going what, what's that, super class, I don't get it.
「父类」的术语都不懂

79
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,354
Okay, you should not even be here, okay.
如果是那样的话，你不应该来参加这门课程

80
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:45,691
Go take these other classes and then come back.
先去参加别的课程，然后再回来

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,062
This is an upper-level CS course, this is not 106 or
这是一门更高等级的 CS 课程

82
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,965
107. Okay? It's a next level up. So if you haven't
它不是 CS106 或 CS107，它是更高一级的东西

83
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:56,802
written a fairly sophisticated app before, okay, then you're
如果你还没有写过一些比较复杂的程序

84
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:00,472
gonna find out whoa, this is a lot of work, okay. So
那你就会发现，你需要学习的东西有很多

85
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,674
that's the prerequisites, make sure you're prepared, for
这就是参加这门课程的条件，确定你已经准备好了

86
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,210
this class. And if you're not, just go take those classes and
如果没有，就先去参加其它课程，然后再回来

87
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,180
come back. All right. So, what's in iOS?
什么是 iOS？

88
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,749
You all know what's in iOS from a user standpoint.
从一个用户的角度，你们应该都知道 iOS 是什么

89
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,951
I'm sure, you've used, all used iOS. So
你确定你们全都用过 iOS

90
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,622
what's kinda under the covers? What are the programming APIs?
但更深层的东西是什么？编程的 API 都是什么？

91
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,791
Everyone know what the words API means? That basically
大家都知道 API 是什么意思

92
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:23,161
programming interface, it's the functions, and methods,
它其实就是编程接口的意思，它是使 iOS App

93
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,698
and classes that we use to make an iOS app work. So
工作的函数、方法和类

94
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,936
what are those APIs that we use? Well they're huge. Okay,
我们能调用的 API 都有什么？它们有很多

95
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,772
there's so much of it I can barely even summarize it here,
API 实在太多了，我都没办法概括出来

96
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,708
but I'm gonna summarize it by dividing it into four layers
但是我可以把它分成四个层次来总结

97
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,445
okay? The core OS which is kind of near the hardware
Core OS 层很接近硬件

98
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,216
all the way up to Cocoa Touch which is near the user, okay?
Cocoa Touch 层很接近用户

99
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,318
And then there's some layers in between. So
在这两层之间还有一些层

100
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,918
let's talk about these layers,
所以我们先分层次来讨论

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,055
let's start down at the bottom there. The hardware.
先从底部开始看，硬件层

102
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:54,159
So, people don't really realize this, but an iPhone
大部分人都没有发现其实 iPhone 运行着 UNIX 系统

103
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,330
is running Unix, okay? There's basically a version of Unix
UNIX 的最基本版本

104
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:02,567
running on it, so it has full multitasking, Unix filesystem,
所以它有多线程、UNIX 文件系统

105
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,303
everything in there. And, you know,
所有 UNIX 有的东西

106
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:08,206
you get the power of that when you build iOS apps, okay? And
在做 iOS 开发的时候你可以运用这些强大的能力

107
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,675
that includes all these things here. Now,
iPhone 包含所有这些

108
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,911
there's some things that this Unix layer, that are specific
还有在 UNIX 这一层特意为了移动设备而打造的东西

109
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,447
to a mobile device like Power Management is really
例如很重要的电量管理

110
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,351
important, Keychain Access to make sure that the people
Keychain，来管理

111
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,753
are not accessing things on the phone that shouldn't,
用户在手机上不应该接触的东西

112
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,524
etc. But this is basically Unix in all its glory,
但这最底层，基本上都是 UNIX 带来的光芒

113
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:30,095
down at this low level. Next, there's a core services layer.
在它上一层，是 Core Services 层

114
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,265
Because we wanna program in object-oriented programming as
因为我们在编写程序的时候尽量用到面向对象

115
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,702
much as possible, there's a layer which is written in
这一层是在 UNIX 之上使用面向对象语言编写的

116
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:40,906
object-oriented language, on top of Unix so that you can
你可以在这一层得到

117
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:44,743
get at things like networking and multithreading and
网络、多线程

118
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,513
network, or preferences and SQL for databases.
或者 SQL 数据库之类的东西

119
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,083
You can get at these things using object oriented APIs.
你可以通过面向对象的 API 来调用这些

120
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,319
So this is kind of an object oriented layer on top of
所以这一层是在 Core Services 之上的面向对象的一层

121
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,589
the core services. Okay but there is no UI in this layer.
在这一层是没有 UI(用户界面) 的

122
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:01,126
Okay this is kind of base layer. Now the next layer,
有点像比较基础的层

123
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,596
super important. Ironically I don't have a lot of time to
下一个非常重要的层

124
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,899
talk about this in this class. I'll kind of let you know it's
我没有太多时间在课堂上介绍它

125
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,369
there but it'll be something you'll have to dive into
你对这一层的了解取决你想要做些什么东西

126
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,605
depending on what you want to do. But that's multimedia.
这一层就是多媒体层

127
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,909
So this is video, all kinds of different audio frameworks.
在这一层，有视频、音频库

128
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,680
And then of course still pictures like JPEGs,
处理例如 JPEG 图片的

129
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,414
things like that and
图片库

130
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,551
drawing okay the Quartz API for drawing in 2D. OpenGL for
用于 2D 绘图的 Quartz API

131
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,388
drawing in 3D. So there's a lot of stuff here okay we
用于 3D 绘图的 OpenGL

132
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,257
obviously don't have time in ten weeks to teach you OpenGL
显然在 10 周的课程之内我不会教你们 OpenGL

133
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,427
you're gonna have to learn that in a graphics class but
你们需要在图形课程里学习

134
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,962
you'll be able to use it here, okay.
并在那里运用

135
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,664
And then at the top layer, this is where were going to
最顶层，就是我们要花几乎所有的时间在的层

136
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,800
spend most of our time, is Cocoa touch, okay.
就是 Cocoa Touch 层

137
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:46,638
It is object-oriented API for building user interfaces okay?
它提供了面向对象的 API 来搭建 UI

138
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,341
And these user interfaces are not just buttons and
这些 UI 元素不仅仅包含

139
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,043
sliders on the screen. But things like,
屏幕上的按扭的滑块

140
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,012
what to do when you shake your phone? Or
还有当你摇动手机的时候应该怎么处理

141
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:58,250
using the orientation of the phone as input for example,
或者把设备的方向当作输入

142
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,086
okay. It also includes animation because in iOS,
它还包含动画

143
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,890
in a lot of the apps there's a lot of animation going on.
因为在 iOS 中，大量的 App 使用动画

144
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,992
It's just part of the way it's being built and
它被搭建的时候这就是其中的一部分了

145
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,461
a lot of the stuff at this level is really high
这一层的许多东西都是非常高层次的

146
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,264
level. Like there are objects that basically let you put
例如，你可以对一个对象进行操作

147
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,701
an entire Safari browser in a rectangle inside your app.
把整个 Safari 浏览器放进你 App 的一块区域中

148
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,336
Okay, this one object you just drag it in,
你可以拖进来一个对象

149
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,071
boom you've got it. All you have to do,
然后你就有对应的功能了

150
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,108
maybe wire up the back button and you're ready to go.
你也许只需要做一个连线就可以了

151
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,278
Same thing with maps. You've seen the whole map 3D maps and
关于地图，你可能见过一些 2D，3D 地图

152
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,814
all that stuff. Again one thing you drag it in,
同样的，你把它拖进来

153
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,816
now you've got full map functionality
你就有了全部地图相关的功能

154
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:34,986
in you application. So this is super powerful objects. Again
它是非常强大的对象

155
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,355
in 10 weeks and I can only show you the basics of this.
在 10 周的课程内，我只能展示给你这些对象的基本用途

156
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,858
Hopefully the things I've chosen to teach you
好在我选择教给你们的东西

157
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,261
will have paradigms for using them. That you can apply to
都有一些使用的范式

158
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,730
the things that I don't have time to teach you, okay.
你可以把它运用到我没有教给你的东西上面

159
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,033
So I'm going to try and teach you the basics
所以我会尽量教给你们让

160
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,436
of how to make it all work in a way that lets you go out and
这些东西基本运行起来的方式

161
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,973
learn new things quite straightforwardly. Okay, so
然后你们就可以通过这种方式来直接学习新的东西了

162
00:07:54,975 --> 00:08:00,145
that's basically what's an iOS in three minutes or less.
所以这就是关于什么是 iOS 的小演讲

163
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,848
The components of the platform that we're gonna be developing
以下这些东西是在这个平台开发所需要的

164
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,185
on are as follows. First, there's some tools. Really,

165
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:11,323
Xcode 7 is 99% of what you're gonna be using in this class.

166
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,959
Okay? It's your editor, your debugger,

167
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,894
source code management, everything is in Xcode7,

168
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,131
it's kind of a one stop shop. There is an extra thing there
它类似于一个一站式的工具

169
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,133
instruments which kind of plugs in with Xcode7 for

170
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,669
doing things like performance, measurement things like that
做一些性能检测之类的事情

171
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,372
but basically we're going to be in Xcode7. Okay, that's
但是基本我们会在 Xcode 7 中干活

172
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:32,344
where we're gonna be doing all our work. Language, languages,
编程语言

173
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,279
there's actually two languages you can develop for
做 iOS 开发你可以使用两种语言

174
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,215
in iOS. We're gonna teach you the more modern one which is
我们会教你更现代的那个，Swift

175
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,618
called Swift, okay? But there's another one called
另一个叫作 Objective-C

176
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,187
Objective C, I'm not really gonna talk about Objective C
我不会太介绍 Objective-C

177
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:47,425
in this class, at least not primarily in the lecture. So
至少在 lecture 中不是作为主要讲解的语言

178
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,960
you will have to learn a new language,
所以你得学一门新的语言

179
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,729
I'm sure none of you know Swift, or
我知道你们都不了解 Swift

180
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,964
if you do, it's because you already know iOS.
如果你了解，是因为你对 iOS 也已经有了了解

181
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,500
So Swift will be a new language you'll have to learn,
Swift 会作为你们必须要学习的新语言

182
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,802
I'll spend the first two weeks really trying to

183
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,406
give you rocket speed learning of this new language.
给你们讲解这门新的语言

184
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,275
Then there's a lot of frameworks,

185
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,811
like foundation and UI kit which is the kinda that base
例如 Foundation 和 UIKit

186
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,247
core services stuff and the UI stuff, but

189
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,724
the object database so there's a lot of frameworks and

190
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,327
we'll cover as many of them as we can. And
还有一些其它的框架，我们将会尽可能地介绍它们

191
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,229
really just as important of all these things,

Now I'm going to, since it's only half of you,
既然只有一半的人了解 MVC

197
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,212
I will spend Wednesday,

00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,701
it. Because I can't really do anything, I can't show you any
因为我还不能做任何事情

204
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:06,304
demo without talking about MVC, it's that important.
在介绍 MVC 之前我不能做任何 demo，它就是这么重要

205
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:10,775
Okay? So this next slide here is kind of giving you

Question? >> The programming
有问题？ 

250
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,270
assignments, they ask you to solve specific tasks?
>> 编程作业是解决特定的编程任务吗？

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,409
do the programming assignments ask you to solve
编程作业是让你解决特定的编程任务

254
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,011
a specific task, or are they kind of open-ended? And
还是有一些开放性的问题？

255
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,781
the answer is the program assignments have very specific
答案是，编程作业有很明确的需求

256
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,551
required tasks that you must do. You can do them any way
你可以通过任何方式完成

262
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,800
that's on Piazza, it explains all that, okay? So for
上面就会有相关的解释了

263
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,902
those of you who arrived late, read that doc,
所以对于迟到的这些同学，去读文档

276
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,344
have more and more projects piling up in this side. And
随着课程的进行，你会有越来越多的项目

277
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,747
then these three choices are the three ways to kinda
这三个先项是进入 Xcode 的三个选项

278
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,416
get into Xcode. 1, Here, playground,
第一个选项 playground

279
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,921
that's basically, it gives you the ability to write iOS apps,
它给了你写 iOS App 的能力

280
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,924
and play with Xcode without building an app. Okay.
但不需要新建一个 App

281
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:49,194
So you can call APIs, put things on screen, draw things,
所以你可以调用 API，画一些控件或图形等等

282
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:52,330
etc. It's kind of a playground for playing around with iOS.
它就像一个学习开发 iOS 应用的小训练场

283
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,599
We really won't be using that much in this app.
我们不会在这个 App 中使用它

284
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,001
But in this class, in my demos, but
但在这门课，或者 demo 中

285
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,404
you can certainly you're welcome to use them,
在你了解 Xcode 的过程中，

286
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,439
as you're playing around with Xcode.
还是欢迎你使用它的

287
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,508
It's kind of a fun environment. Down at
它是个很有趣的编程环境

288
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,911
the bottom here you can check out an existing Xcode,
在最下面，你可以添加已有

289
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:11,716
project, iOS project, that is in Source Code, management.
源码管理的 Xcode 项目

290
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,118
Okay, now we're going to talk about Source Code management
也许会在周五的课程中讨论源码管理

291
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,888
probably at a Friday section in this quarter but
但是不会在

292
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,122
not right at the beginning of the class.
这门课程刚开始的时候就讲

293
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,859
But Source Code manager is basically a way that you can
源码管理就是你可以通过类似数据库的方式

294
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,728
check your code in and out of like a database okay,
来管理你的源代码

295
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,131
so that you can work with a team, each make changes,
通过这种方式进行团队协作

296
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,099
merge your changes, all that stuff.
每个人对代码产生一些修改，然后合并这些修改之类的

297
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:32,370
So here is where you would check out your project to work
所以这个就是你获取已有源码管理项目的地方

298
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:36,207
on. And this middle one is to create a new Xcode project,
中间的这个是新建一个 Xcode 项目

299
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,176
a new Xcode App and that's we're gonna do right now,
现在就进行这一项

300
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,212
okay? We're gonna create from scratch a new app. Most of my
从头开始创建一个新的 App

301
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,449
demos involved creating an application from scratch,
几乎所有的 demo 都是从头开始创建的

302
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,750
okay? Just because I think it's easier for
因为在目前阶段

303
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,120
you to learn if there's no magic behind the scenes where
从零开始写项目

304
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:49,921
things are appearing out of nowhere. So
对你们来说更容易一些

305
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:53,658
where gonna start from scratch and go from there each time.
所以我们从头开始新建应用

306
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
All right, so I'm gonna click on this.
点这里

307
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,029
You can see it wants to create an app for me so
它会为我新建一个应用

308
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,264
it's gonna ask me some questions.
会问我几个问题

309
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,866
First it wants to know what kind of app I wanna build, and
首先，它问我想要创建哪种类型的应用

310
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,903
we wanna build an iOS application. So make sure you
我们想新建 iOS App

311
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:09,974
click iOS Application here, not watch app, or AppleTV app,
所以确认你点击了 iOS Application，而不是其它的

312
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,610
or an OS X app, okay? We don't want any of that.
我们不想要其它的

313
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,047
We want iOS application. And inside there we have some
我们想要 iOS 应用

314
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,652
choices of the kind of iOS app we wanna build, like a game or
在这里，它问我们想要建哪种类型的 iOS 应用

315
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,087
this master detail which is usually for browsing
例如是 Game 还是为了浏览数据库的 Master Detail Application

316
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,890
a database. We're almost always gonna choose this one,
我们几乎只会先择这一项

317
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:30,028
single view application. The view there is kinda referring
Single View Application，这里的 View 代表

318
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,196
to the view in MVC, model view controller.
MVC 中的 V

319
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,667
That design paradigm but this is the ba-, most basic
这个模板会为我们的创建最基本的

320
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,003
template and it gives us the least amount of code to start
MVC 骨架，它会产生最少量的代码

321
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,472
with, which is what we want cuz we're learning so we wanna
这也是我们希望的

322
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,676
write the code. We don't want it to, write any code for us.
我们正在学习，所以希望写代码的是我们，而不是 Xcode

323
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,678
So we're gonna pick single view template there.
所以这里选择 Single View 的模板

324
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,447
Now it wants to know a few things about our app,
现在它需要知道关于 App 的几点信息

325
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,784
what the name of our app is, etc. The app we're going
App 的名字是什么等等

326
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,853
to build today is a calculator and it's gonna look quite
今天要创建的应用是一个计算器

327
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,790
a bit like this calculator, not exactly the same, but
它看起来非常像一个计算器，但又不完全一致

328
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,826
similar to this calculator. This is a basic calculator,
它会像这个，最基本的计算器

329
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,262
it comes with Mac OS and it's gonna look like this,
是 Mac OS 上的原生应用

330
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,464
it's gonna have some keypads, gonna have some operations,
它会有键盘，会有运算符

331
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,867
gonna have a little display in here. Basically a calculator,
在这里还会有个小显示器

332
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,336
so I'm gonna call my app calculator.
所以给我的 App 起名为 calculator

333
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,938
So that's the name of this app. When I look at it on my
它就是 App 的名字，当我在手机上查看它的时候

334
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,074
phone it's gonna say calculator is the name of it.
上面显示的名字就会是 calculator

335
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:19,010
Okay? This organization name can be anything you want.
这个组织名你可以随意填

336
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,880
It's basically gonna appear in the copyright of your code.
它会显示在你代码的版权信息上

337
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,748
Okay? When you write code,
当你写代码的时候

338
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,116
at the top it's gonna say copyright,
在最上面会显示版权信息

339
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,718
whatever you put here. Put whatever you want.
你可以在这里放什么都行

340
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,953
Your name or whatever. This however,
姓名之类的

341
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:33,925
wants to uniquely identify you, okay, as a developer. And
这里，需要一个不重复的标识

342
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,728
a good way to do it is this reverse DNS notation here,
一个解决这个问题的很好方式是这个逆向的 DNS 标志

343
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,698
edu.stanford.cs193p and then instead of putting instructor,
edu.stanford.cs193p

344
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,268
put your SU net ID. Cuz no one else has that.
在 instructor 那里填上你的学号就好，因为这不会重复

345
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,304
This would uniquely identify you in the universe.
这会在宇宙中唯一确定你

346
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,407
No one else is going to have that organization identifier.
没人会跟你重复的

347
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,875
And then it builds a unique
随后它会产生一个独一无二的标识

348
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,679
identifier from the app by combining these two things.
通过把这两个结合起来的方式

349
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,315
Okay? You get to choose the language you want to program
在这里选择你想要编程的语言

350
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,385
in here. It actually doesn't matter what you choose
在这里选择什么无关紧要

351
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,154
here, this is just going to be the language that the initial
它只会为你创建

352
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,723
template is going to give you it starts out in.
相关语言的初始模板

353
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,525
You can freely mix Objective C and
在写 iOS 应用的时候

354
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,561
Swift when you're building IOS apps. Okay? Back and
你可以把 Swift 和 Objective-C 混合起来

355
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,364
forth they're, you don't have to pick one and be stuck with
你不需要在选择完一个之后就卡在这了

356
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,234
it. We're going to do all of our programming in this class
在这门课中我们所有的编程都会使用 Swift

357
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:19,570
in Swift however. Then this is whether we want
这里决定我们是要搭建一个

358
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,139
to build an iPhone only calculator.
专属 iPhone 的


359
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,909
An iPad only calculator. Or a universal calculator that will
还是 iPad 的

360
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,979
work on either iPad or iPhone. Okay? And
或者是它们都可以使用的计算器

361
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,181
we're gonna go universal even though the first two weeks
选择 universal，尽管前两周

362
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,151
we're going to be focusing on iPhone only. In the third week
我们只会专注在 iPhone 上

363
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:37,688
we'll expand our calculator to work on an iPad as well. Here,
在第三周，我们会让计算器在 iPad 上也正常地跑起来

364
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,657
we're not going to be using databases yet, that will be
目前我们还不需要使用数据库

365
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,661
about week six and we will be talking about testing later in
第六周我们会讨论测试

366
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,563
the quarter. Probably in a Friday section again, but
也许在周五的课程中

367
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,733
we're not doing it now so you can leave these unchecked.
我们现在不会处理这些，所以这些不需要勾选

368
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,767
All right, so now I hit Next, and
点 Next

369
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,037
it says where do you wanna put this project? I'm gonna put
它问你想把项目放在哪里

370
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,808
it in my home directory, in a folder called Developer, and
我把它放到 ~/Developer 中

371
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,444
I highly recommend you do the same, okay.
我也建议你们这样做

372
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,180
Home Directory Developer, so all your apps will start
~/Developer，你们所有的 App 都放到这里

373
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,750
piling up in here. Here's the source control thing I was
关于源码管理

374
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,785
talking about, we're not gonna do this at the beginning, so
我们一开始先不管

375
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,521
we're gonna leave this unchecked. All right. So
所以先不勾选

376
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,324
we hit create, and it creates our first app. Now, it's
点 create，它就创建了我们的第一个 App

377
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,961
actually created these six files, over here on the side.
它实际上创建了这 6 个文件，在这侧边

378
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:17,762
And over the course of the quarter,
在课程期间

379
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,498
I'll show you what all six of these are about. Today,
我会告诉你们这 6 个文件都是做什么的

380
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,768
we're only gonna focus on two of them.
今天我们只会关注这两个

381
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,772
How many of you have used Xcode before, for any class or
你们有谁用过 Xcode？

382
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,509
anything? Okay, so about a third of you.
好，大概 1/3

383
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,178
So let me explain a little bit about Xcode's UI,
我先介绍一下 Xcode 的 UI

384
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,781
what it looks like. You see this area on the left,
左边这里

385
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,051
this blue area? That's called the Navigator and
蓝色的区域，它是 Navigator(导航器)

386
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,554
it's basically for navigating your project.
它用来导航你的项目

387
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,755
And you can do it in different ways.
通过几种不同的方式

388
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,459
This is the Project Navigator that we see right here, and
现在这个是项目导航

389
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,595
it's basically showing you your files.
它用来显示项目的文件

390
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,029
You can arrange them in folders and stuff, but
你可以通过文件夹来重新组织它们

391
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,166
just basically the files in your app. But you can navigate
但只是导航 App 中的文件

392
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,669
by searching, okay, you can type some search text in here,
但是你可以通过搜索来查找 App 文件中的内容

393
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,472
search for it in your app. You can navigate all your
如果你在 debug 的时候

394
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,675
breakpoints if you're debugging. You can go back and
可以在这里查看所有断点

395
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,345
look at all your old builds to see any errors or
查看之前编译版本的错误或警告

396
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:11,149
warnings you have, okay, even if you fixed it you go back,
即使你已经修复了它们并返回了

397
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,484
and look at them. So the navigator is kind
Navigator 就像是用来关注

398
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,521
of how you keep track of what's going on in your app.
你的 App 到底发生了什么事情的地方

399
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,457
On the right hand side here we have the utilities area,
在右手边，有 Utilities(工具) 区

400
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,426
which is actually two windows, see it's split top and
有两个窗口，分成上下两部分

401
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:26,230
bottom here. The top part is essentially an inspector,
上部是 Inspector(监视器)

402
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,800
it's going to let you analyze and change attributes of
你可以通过它看到或改变

403
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,004
whatever's selected in this main window. Right now we
在主窗口选中的东西的属性

404
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,673
don't have anything selected, so it's not showing anything.
现在没有选中任何东西，所以没显示任何东西

405
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,676
And this bottom is essentially like a palette. Okay,
这下面的部分就像一个调色板

406
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,979
you're gonna be an artist building your app, okay, and
在写应用的时候，你就是一个艺术家

407
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,983
you're gonna need things like buttons and web views,
因为你需要类似于 button 或 web view 之类的东西

408
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,818
and things like that, to build your app, and
用来搭建你的应用

409
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,953
you're gonna be finding them all,
你会在这里找到它们

410
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,122
and pulling them all out of here. So it's your palette,
然后可以从这里把它们拖出来，所以这就是你的调色板

411
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,825
your artist palette, as you build things. Okay? You can
你的艺术调色板，用来创造东西

412
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,361
show and hide these two side panels with these buttons,
你可以通过这些按扭显示或者隐藏侧面的面板

413
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,831
up here. I will tend to not do command keys, except for
我尽量不使用快捷键，除了复制粘贴

414
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,801
like copy and paste, so that you can see what's going on.
所以你们就可以知道我到底做了哪些事情

415
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,204
But there are tons of command keys in Xcode, and
但是 Xcode 中有大量的快捷键

416
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:10,441
if you go To Xcode preferences and look under
在 Xcode 的设置界面

417
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,610
key bindings right here you can see all of them and
你可以发现有大量大量的快捷键

418
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,680
there's tons and tons and tons and you can even change them.
你也可以对它们进行定制

419
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,348
Of course if you don't like them but
如果你不喜欢它们也没关系

420
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,849
it has a lot of commands. All right, so
但是它有大量的快捷键

421
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,886
I'll try to avoid using those command keys. So you can hide
我尽量不使用快捷键

422
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,756
those with these things so you have hidden both sides, right.
可以使用按扭来做这些事情

423
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,426
So you can kind of manage your screen real estate.
你可以管理屏幕的分辨率

424
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,662
Now I have a very low-resolution screen here, so
我电脑的分辨率非常低

425
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,732
I have to manage my real estate quite efficiently.
所以为了高效我需要改变自己的分辨率

426
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,567
If you have a higher resolution screen,
如果你的分辨率很高

427
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,837
then you would obviously not be doing as much hiding and
你就不需要把这些东西给隐藏起来了

428
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,108
showing of these things. So if we look at the navigator,
现在我们看 Navigator

429
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,775
what's selected right now?
当前选中的是什么？

430
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,980
It's the project itself at the very top level, this blue bar.
是最顶层的项目本身

431
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:49,680
This selecting the project.
它选中了项目

432
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,217
So we're actually seeing the project, the kind
所以在主窗口

433
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,820
of settings of the project, in the main window here.
我们可以看到这个项目的设置

434
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,624
This main window. Here are some of them here, right?
这个主窗口，这里有一些设置

435
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,325
Some of these we set on that first page,
第一页有一些可以设置的

436
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:05,029
like the bundle identifier and whether it was universal or
例如 Bundle Identifier（包的 ID）

437
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,898
iPad and iPhone, etc. But there's plenty more
是通用的还是只为了 iPhone 或 iPad 而造

438
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,868
settings over here. We'll get to most of those settings as
这里还有许多其它设置信息

439
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,372
the quarter goes by. The only setting that's important for
随着课程的进行，我们会逐渐了解这些设置

440
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,540
you to know now, is this team setting.
现在需要知道的设置信息是这个 team

441
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,477
See here where it says team none? You're gonna wanna be
现在上面显示的是 none

442
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:24,782
able to write your app, and have it run on a device. Okay.
你想让你写的 App 运行在真实的设备上

443
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,817
It has a simulator, which I'm gonna use today.
我们今天会使用模拟器

444
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,253
But you also wanna be able to run on a device. And
但是你想让它运行在真实的设备上

445
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:33,124
to do that you need to register an Apple ID.
为了这样，我们需要注册一个 Apple ID

446
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,060
So here I already have mine, this CS193p Instructor, but
我已经注册好了

447
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,630
you're going to go down here to add an account, and
不过你需要在这下面添加一个账号

448
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,466
you're going to give an Apple ID and password. Any Apple ID
填入 Apple ID 和密码

449
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,736
will do, you don't have to join any program or anything,
任意一个 Apple ID 都可以，不需要加入什么开发者计划之类的

450
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,372
just any Apple ID will work here. And
普通的 Apple ID 就可以

451
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,874
you'll put the ID and password in, and
填入 ID 和密码

452
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,676
then you're going to select it here. And
选这里

453
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:56,280
then it's going to appear here, like this. Okay? Now,
它会在这里出现

454
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,617
when you have a team selected now you can plug a device
当 team 有选择的东西以后，你就可以插上一个设备

455
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,720
in and you're gonna get this warning here, no provisioning
会有一个没有证书的警告

456
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:07,158
profiles found. And you just click fix issue right there.
点这里的 fix issue 

457
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,926
You have to be connected to the network at the time,
这时你需要联网

458
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,829
all right? Fix issue and it'll fix that.
它会修复这个问题

459
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,198
It'll basically get the ID of your device,
它会获取你设备的 ID

460
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,436
register it with you as the developer and off you go.
注册成为开发者，然后就可以了

461
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,672
Okay? So you'll need to do that. You only really need to
你只需要在想把 App 运行在真实设备的时候

462
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,808
do that when it comes to running on a device.
才需要解决这个问题

463
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,476
When we're running in a simulator you're not gonna
当在模拟器上运行的时候

464
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,913
need to do that, but you might as well get this started now.
就不用这么做

465
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,316
Okay? Now what about these other files over here in the
Navigator 中的其它这些文件

466
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,453
navigator that it made these 6 files. Well like I said, were
都有什么作用呢？

467
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,922
not going to talk about all of them. This one for example,
我不会对它们每一个都进行详细讲解

468
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:42,093
assets.xcassetts. That's all your media assets. So that's
例如 assets.xcassets 是存放媒体文件的地方

469
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:46,997
images, sounds, icons, things like that. Here for example is
图片，声音和图标之类的东西

470
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:47,965
the app icon which I haven't set so
例如这里的应用图标

471
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:51,635
all of these are all blank. So we're not really gonna talk
我还没有设置，所以这些都是空白的

472
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,738
about that today but we'll eventually talk about it.
我今天不会介绍，但总有一天会介绍的

473
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,841
And in fact not only am I not gonna talk about
实际上今天我不但不会介绍这个 xcassets 文件

474
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:59,877
this xcassets thing right here, but I'm also not gonna
同样我也不会介绍

475
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,813
talk about this app delegate or the launch screen or
AppDelegate 和 LaunchScreen 还有

476
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,350
the info.plist. Okay, so I'm gonna select all those and
info.plist 文件

477
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:10,254
right-click on them and choose new group from selection and
我选中它们

478
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,424
put them all in a folder. Okay, which I'm gonna call
然后右键为它们新建一个组

479
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:17,261
supporting files. Because that's what they are really,
起名为 Supporting files

480
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,330
they're kind of files to support my app.
因为它们对我 App 起的就是支持作用

481
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:20,264
You see they're still there,
你看，它们还在这里

482
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,799
I just kind of got them out of the way so
我只是把它们清理一下

483
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,834
we can focus on these two files
这样我就可以关注这两个文件

484
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:27,972
which is the most important thing to our demo today. Okay?
它俩是今天 demo 中最重要的部分

485
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,409
Now what are these two files? Now is where I have to talk
这俩文件是干什么的？

486
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,812
about this MVC thing, okay? So MVC stands for
现在我就得讲讲 MVC 了

487
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:39,917
Model View Controller, okay? Model View Controller is a way
MVC 代表 Model(模型) View(视图) Controller(控制器)

488
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,354
of kind of dividing up all the classes in our object orient
MVC 是一种把我们面向对象 App 中的类分成几种不同组的方式

489
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,457
app into three different groups, the model group,
Model 组

490
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,826
the view group, and the controller group.
View 组和 Controller 组

491
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,163
Okay, what are those three groups? The model group is
这三个组都是什么？Model 组是

492
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:55,900
what our program does It's UI independent.
关于我们的 App 是做什么的，它与 UI 是独立的

493
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,736
So for a calculator it's going to be all the calculating.
对于计算器来说，它是关于计算的

494
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,172
The things that actually does the calculations, right?
它实际做的事情就是计算，对吧？

495
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:04,275
That's UI independent, that's going to be our model, okay?
它是 UI 独立的，它就是我们的 Model

496
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:08,012
The view is the user interface that the user interacts with.
View 就是用户直接接触的 UI 界面

497
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:11,315
So for the calculator it's the buttons and the display and
对于计算器来说就是按扭还有显示之类的东西

498
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,051
all that stuff. That is the view. Okay, usually that's
这就是 View

499
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,254
made of generic user interface elements like buttons and
通常它是由基本的例如按扭之类的 UI 元素组成

500
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,391
things like that. And then there's the controller,
接着就是 Controller

501
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:23,461
the controller is the glue between the model and
controller 是 model 与 view 之间的粘合剂

502
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,130
the view. Okay, it's the thing that listens to what's
它会监听UI发生了些什么事情

503
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:30,267
happening in the UI, makes decisions, updates the model,
做出决定，传达给 model，让 model 更新

504
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:30,901
something changes in the model,
model 里的一些东西就会发生改变

505
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:34,438
maybe it changes the UI. Okay, back and forth is really where
可能会改变UI，好的，说来说去

506
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,608
the interface, the logic of our entire app really
我们 app 的整套逻辑生存在 controller 里

507
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,879
lives in our controller, okay? So, this file right here,
okay? 所以，这有一个文件

508
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:45,950
ViewController.swift, that is our controller, okay?
ViewController.swift，这就是我们的 controller，okay?

509
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:51,355
Our app only has one MVC, okay? Which is the calculator,
我们的app仅有一个 MVC，okay? 就是这个计算器

510
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,024
MVC and this is it's controller, okay,
MVC和它是这个app的 controller，okay?

511
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:59,296
the C of MVC. Now, here is your first look at Swift. E,
MVC中的 C，现在，这里是你看到的第一个 swift 程序

512
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,598
we're gonna, I'm gonna explain this little,
我等下将会解释一下这个东西

513
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,168
real briefly. You can see that Xcode has thrown in a couple
非常简单，你可以看到 Xcode 里有一些方法

514
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,571
of methods for me. Everyone knows what a method is.
大家都知道方法是什么

515
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,874
They're so exciting that I'm gonna delete them, okay?
我要删除掉它们，它们显得非常 exciting! okay?

516
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,910
That's because I, I don't wanna distract you with a lot
因为我不想你们被这些代码带走注意力

517
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,513
of random code, so we're gonna keep down just to the minimal
所以我们只保留我们要用的代码

518
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,547
code we're gonna use. We don't,
所以我们只保留我们要用的代码
519
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,783
we will be using those methods later in the course.
我们在后续课程中会用到这些方法

520
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,318
Those are part of what's called the view-controller
这些就是所说的 view-controller 的一部分

521
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,189
lifecycle. But we don't need it for our calculator app. So
但我们的计算器里不需要它

522
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,357
let's look at what we have left here.
所以我们看看留在这里的代码

523
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,461
This import is kind of like an include in other languages or
这个 import 就像其它语言里的 include 一样

524
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,864
import in other languages. But this is not a file,
或是其它语言里的 import，但这不是一个文件

525
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,368
this is a module. And in Swift, you can group a whole
它是一个模块，在 swift 中，你可以把一堆类打包在一起

526
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:42,306
bunch of classes together. And that's called a module. And
这就可以叫做一个模块

527
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,976
when you import a module all those classes will be visible,
当你导入一个模块，里面所有的类都对你可见

528
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,947
if they're public classes, to whatever is using it. So here,
当然如果它们是 public 类的话，不管谁用都如此

529
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:53,751
UI kit has all these interface things, buttons, text fields,
所以这个 UIkit 里有所有的的界面，按钮，文本框

530
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,620
all that stuff is in there. And so since we're building
所有的东西都在这个模块里，因为我们要做一个 UI app

531
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,924
a UI app here, a calculator, we're gonna import UIkit, and
一个计算器，我们我们要导入 UIkit

532
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:02,059
you're almost always gonna import UIkit,
你几乎总是需要导入这个模块

533
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,828
okay? Now in our model, where it's UI independent,
现在在我们的 model 中，UI是独立的

534
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,298
we're gonna probably be importing foundation.
我们也许需要导入 foundation 框架

535
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,967
Foundation is that core services thing, okay?
Foundation 是一个核心框架，okay？

536
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,268
Cuz we might be doing networking and
因为我们可能需要网络编程

537
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,370
databasing in our model, but we're not doing buttons and
或者使用数据库，但我们不需要做一些按钮之类的东西

538
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:17,374
stuff. So those are the two main things you import, okay.
所以这两个模块你需要导入

539
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:21,078
Here is the definition, declaration really,
这里是 swift 里对一个类进行定义时看起来的样子

540
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,248
of a class in Swift is what it looks like.
这里是 swift 里对一个类进行定义时看起来的样子

541
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,052
You've got the class keyword. This is the name of the class,
你需要用到 class 关键字，这是这个类的名字

542
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,020
ViewController. Now this is a pretty bad name,
ViewController，一个很差劲的名字

543
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,190
okay, because its very generic, ViewController
因为 ViewController 这个名字不够具体

544
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,160
probably be better called calculator controller, or
我们最好叫它计算器 controller

545
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,394
calculator view controller.
或者计算器 view controller 之类的名字

546
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,363
I'm not gonna show you how to rename that now.
我现在不会教你们怎么重命名

547
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,766
But I will show you next week. But this is the name of our
在下周我会展示给你看，这是我们 controller 类的名字

548
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,937
controller class. This colon UIViewController, means that
这个 UIViewController 意味着

549
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,808
UIViewController is the class our controller inherits from.
我们的类继承于 UIViewController 类

550
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,277
This is object oriented program, we have inheritance.
这是个面向对象程序，需要继承机制

551
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,914
This is the inheritance. Single inheritance in Swift.
这就是一个 swift 里单继承的例子

552
00:26:56,916 --> 00:27:01,485
All controllers, all MVC controllers must inherit from
所有的 controller，所有的 MVC controller 都必须

553
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,521
UIViewController either directly or indirectly from
直接或间接地继承于 UIViewController

554
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:08,125
UIViewController. Okay, then we have a curly brace here,
Okay，这里我们有了大括号

555
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,695
inside those curly braces goes all of our properties and
所有的属性和方法写在这个括号里

556
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:14,131
methods. Properties are like instance variables.
比方说一些变量

557
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,299
Everyone knows what an instance variable is,
每个人都该知道什么是实例变量

558
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,636
right? So our property, we call them properties in Swift.
在 swift 中我们称 property 是属性

559
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,438
They're very powerful in Swift, the instance variables.
实例变量在 swift 里面非常有用

560
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,007
They can have behavior associated with them and
它们可以被一些有关联的行为改变

561
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:26,543
things like that. But all that goes inside these curly
但所有的一切都发生在这对大括号里

562
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,247
braces, okay? So that's your intro to Swift.
好吗？ 所以这就是对 swift 的简短介绍

563
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,350
What about this other file over here? Main.storyboard,
这个 Main.storyboard 文件又是怎么回事？

564
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:39,089
what's that? That's the V for view of our NVC. That's
它是什么呢？就是 MVC 里面的 V

565
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,559
the graphical representation of our calculator.
它代表着我们的计算器的图形界面

566
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,962
So let's click on that, and see what it looks like.
所以我们点它一下， 看看会发生什么

567
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:49,833
Right now, it's just a big square. Big empty square here.
现在，它只是一个大方块，大的空方块

568
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,935
And I can zoom in and out, so I'll zoom to 50%,
我可以放大和缩小，那我就缩小50%

569
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:55,572
see? Here's our UI, now, it's kinda interesting,
看，这就是我们的UI, 有点意思对不对

570
00:27:55,574 --> 00:28:02,946
this UI is square, okay? How many iOS products are square?
这个UI是方形的，okay? 有多少iOS程序是方形的？

571
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,717
Zero, right? None of them are, they're all rectangular, okay?
零个，记住了吗？没有一个是方形的，它们都是长方形的

572
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,520
So they're either landscape or portrait, you know, iPads,
而且他们不是横屏的就是竖屏的，你知道的

573
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,388
whatever. None of them are square.
没有一个是方形的

574
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,093
So how are we building our UI in a square UI? Well we're
所以如何在这个方形UI中建立我们自己的UI?

575
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:19,263
doing that to remind us that we want to build our UI so
时刻谨记，我们要建立自己的UI

576
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,901
that it stretches and expands and moves things around so
它能够伸缩自如，也得能移动UI里的东西

577
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,470
that it will fit in any shape. Okay,
并且能够适应不同的设备

578
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,039
so we're gonna build one UI, it's gonna work on iPad,
所以我们要做一个可以在各种iPad 

579
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,209
iPhone, tall iPhones, short iPhones, high resolution ones,
iPhone，长iPhone，短iPhone，高分辨率设备

580
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,713
low resolution, all of them from this one UI. And this is
低分辨率设备，所有的设备只需要一个UI

581
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,516
square to remind us that if this were vertical rectangle,
这个方形提醒我们 如果这是个垂直长方形

582
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,186
probably our UI would look great in portrait, but
或许它更适合竖屏使用

583
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:42,386
good in landscape. This way, square, it's constantly
这样，对于横屏使用来讲

584
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,089
maybe not so
或许就不那么合适

585
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,591
reminding us that we have to build this flexible UI.
不要忘了我们要做一个足够灵活的UI

586
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,059
Now today, I'm not gonna do that.
今天我并不打算做这件事

587
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,463
I'm gonna build the UI all up in the upper left corner right
我会在这个左上角上建立我们的UI

588
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,531
here so that it looks good in any, or
或许好看

589
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:58,569
not looks good, but at least shows up in any shape. But
或许不好看，但至少适用于任何设备

590
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,472
on Wednesday, we'll put in the flexibility to make it,
星期三的时候，我们教你们一些方法

00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:06,577
do what it needs to do, okay. So, how do we build this UI?
来给它注入更多的灵活性。所以，我们如何建造这个UI?

592
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,747
We build our entire UI graphically. Okay,
我们用图形拖拽的方式，Okay?

593
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,116
with the mouse. Okay, we do not write code,
用鼠标，我们不需要写任何代码

594
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:16,420
to say put button here, to put text field there. We just
把按钮放在这里，把文本框放在那里

595
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:20,557
build it all graphically, and wire it up with our mouse. And
我们只需要用图形的方式来完成，用鼠标做这事

596
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
so we're just going to dive right into doing that.
现在我们马上就开始做这个UI

597
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:26,263
I'm building a calculator. A calculator needs some buttons.
我要做一个计算器，一个计算器需要一些按键

598
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,464
So let's start with a button.
那么我们就从按键开始

599
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,834
I told you that in this utilities window at the bottom
我告诉过你们在 utilities 窗口

600
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:34,037
there's the palette of things you as an artist, and now we
有一个“调色板”提供给你这个“艺术家”

601
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,975
are UI artists here, are going to build our UI out of. And
现在我们就是UI设计艺术家，将要创造我们的UI

602
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:41,645
you can see there is whoops. Get that back out of the way.
你可以看见，whoops，把它放到后面去

603
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,848
There we go. Lots and lots of things that we can build our
好了，这里面有很多很多东西我们可以拿来

604
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,918
UI out of here, and we'll talk about actually most of these
构造我们的UI,接下面的几周这些东西

605
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,654
in the ten weeks we have, but we're gonna start about
大多我们都会介绍，但从大概这个四分之一

606
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:54,258
a quarter of the way down with this one right here button.
的位置这的这个按钮开始

607
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,026
And I'm just gonna pick this up.
我将会点击它

608
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,496
And drag it out, it's my UI. Now when I do that,
把它拖出来，这就是我的UI，当我做这事的时候

609
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,566
notice that these blue lines appear and disappear.
注意下这些出现又消失蓝色的线条

610
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:06,603
The blue lines help you put something in a theoretical or
这些蓝色线条帮你把东西放在合适的地方

611
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:10,774
conceptual place. Like this would be putting the button
就像这个给我参考，让我把这个按钮放在

612
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,477
in the conceptual center of my UI. So
我UI框架的中心

613
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,079
if I am portrait it's going to be centered in portrait.
如果我竖屏，它会处于竖屏的中心位置

614
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,882
If I go to landscape it will move over and be in landscape.
如果我横屏，它会移动到横屏的中心位置去

615
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:22,853
Do you understand what I'm saying? These blue lines allow
你明白我在说什么吗？这些蓝色线条

616
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,088
us to put things in various places and
让我们能把UI元素放在很多地方

617
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,423
this is a big part of how we're going to
对于如何做出一个灵活的UI来说，这些

618
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,159
make this flexible UI. But since I told you I'm not gonna
蓝色线条很关键，不过我已经说了周三再来展示

619
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,094
show you that until Wednesday, we're not gonna do that.
所以今天我不会管它

620
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,764
We're not gonna use the blue lines, okay. But you'll see me
我们不使用这些蓝色线条，okay，等到周三

621
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,766
using the blue lines on Wednesday quite a bit and
我才会告诉你们怎么使用这些线条

622
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:37,234
you'll want to always use the blue lines.
然后你们就离不开它了

623
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:41,071
The blue lines are super important to building this
对于做一个足够灵活的UI来讲

624
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,139
flexible adaptable UI.
这些蓝色线条特别重要

625
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,608
All right, so we have our button right here, now we
好了，所有现在我们的按键摆在那了

626
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,711
don't want it to say button on there. Okay, we want it to be
现在我不想要这个空白按键呆在那，我想要

627
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:50,747
one of the numbers this is gonna be part of our keypad.
它变成我们的一个数字按键

628
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,016
So I'm gonna make this be my five button. And
所以我要把它变成“5”这个按键

629
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,552
to change the text you can just double click on it and
要改变它的文本信息你只需要双击它

630
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,989
change it. So I'm gonna make it 5. You notice it also has
然后改成你要的文本，所以我把它改成“5”，

631
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,825
these little handles around the edge. You can use those to
你可以看见这些边缘上的小框框，你可以用它改变按钮的大小

632
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,229
resize it to whatever you want. So this is computer
这是一门计算机科学课

633
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,466
science class, so we'll make it be 64 by 64, okay? Although
所以我们把它做成64*64大小的，okay?

634
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,636
it really doesn't matter what size I make this, because when
不过我把它做成什么大小真的不重要

635
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,072
it starts being flexible it's gonna start you know,
因为面对不同的环境的时，一个灵活的UI

636
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:18,141
resizing it to fit depending on what's the environment, but
可以让这些按钮自动变换到合适的尺寸

637
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:21,345
anyway we'll do that. Now other things I wanna change
不过我还是示范下，现在，这个按钮还有一些需要改变的地方

638
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,480
about this button I don't do directly.
但我不直接做

639
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:27,517
I need to use this top half of the utilities window here,
我需要用到 utilities 窗口的上半部分

640
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,721
which is the Inspector. Okay, now there's different kinds of
这是一个检测窗口，Okay，现在这有一些

641
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,557
inspectors along the top you'll see here. What you,
不同的种类的检测

642
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,926
what's showing now is the Attributes Inspector.
现在你看到的是属性监测

643
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,129
That, that is the attributes of whatever is selected.
无论我选中了什么属性都会展示在上边

644
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,899
Here is the size inspector. So if I click that, for
这里时一个尺寸监测，所以如果我点击它

645
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:45,269
example here's my 64 by 64 and I can edit it here as well.
这里就是我的64*64，我们同样也能在这里改变尺寸

646
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:50,774
I can say 200 by 64, see how this got wide, all right?
我可以改成200*64，看这个怎么变得更宽，all right?

647
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,443
We can go back to 64.
我们也可以改回64

648
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,979
Okay. I'm going to go back to the app.
好了，回到我们的app

649
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:58,415
And we will talk about these other ones the identity and
我们将会在之后再介绍身份监测，这之类些东西

650
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,752
Spector later. But lets go back here to attributes and
回到我们的属性界面

651
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,154
inspector this is actually object oriented. So
这是面向对象的，所以

652
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,623
here I can set the attributes of a button because that's
所以我能设置这个按钮的属性

653
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:10,027
what's selected here. And also I can set the attributes of
同样我也能设置这个 controls 属性

654
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,830
a control, which is buttons super class, and
它是按键的父类

655
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,634
then attributes of view, which is controls super class.
再设置 view 里面的属性，它是 controls 的父类

656
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,537
So this goes right up the hierarchy of the inherit
所以它们遵循着继承的体系，一个类继承于另一个

657
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,640
hierarchy, rather, and lets me set various things.
现在让我设置一些东西

658
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,543
For example, I want this five to be bigger, so
比如，我想要这个“5”更大一点

659
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,447
I look here in the buttons attributes and I see font,
所以我看看这个按钮的属性，我看到了“字体”

660
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,850
system font, 15 point. I'm gonna click this and
系统字体，15号，我点击它一下

661
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:37,154
change this to be 30 point system font. Okay,
把它变成30号的字体，Okay

662
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:41,291
that looks a lot better. And if I go back and look at this
看起来好多了，如果我再回去看看这个计算器

663
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,961
calculator, see how some of the buttons have a background,
看如何使这个按钮有不同颜色的背景

664
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,763
like grey or orange? I want that too so I'm gonna set
比如绿色或者橘色，所以我设置一下

665
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,599
the background of this to something, so I'm gonna
这个按钮的背景色

666
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,803
go down that turns out to be something that button inherits
所以我往下滑，发现这个按钮的背景

667
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,205
from view, right here background.
继承于 view，就在这里
668
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:59,042
So I can set it by, you know, using crayons,
所以我可以用不同色的蜡笔来改变它

669
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:02,045
okay, whatever you can use sliders or I can
okay, 无论你用什么都行

670
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:05,782
use maybe recently used ones like here's light grey, okay?
我可以用我最近用过的颜色，比如浅灰，okay?

671
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,185
So, I've substituted my nice little background here so,
这样我就更换了我们这个按钮的背景颜色

672
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,721
you know, you can go and edit these things and make them
你们可以编辑这些东西，把按键变成任何你们想要的样子

673
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:14,858
look however you want, what's interesting about what's going
有趣的地方在这

674
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,261
on here is this...there's no code generation step gonna
这里并没有产生任何代码

675
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:21,932
happen here. You're actually editing these objects live.
你只是改变了这个按键的样子

676
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:25,669
Okay. By changing things in the inspector you're sending
通过改变检测窗口里的东西

677
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,172
messages to this button to set the way it is and
你在给按键发送信息，把它设置成你想要的样子

678
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:33,610
then the Xcode has a way to essentially freeze dry
接着 Xcode 就有办法完成你的请求

679
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,545
all the attributes, and it's object oriented.
改变按钮的属性，这是面向对象

680
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,147
In other words, the objects are participating and
换言之，Xcode 能够把这些操作

681
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:42,419
freeze drying themselves. And in fact, the whole mechanism
转换成对按键对象的代码的操作，事实上

682
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,856
of this part of Xcode which we call interface builder,
Xcode 的这套机制被我们叫做 ”interface builder”

683
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,925
cuz we're building our user interface, is extensible and
因为我们在为用户做界面，它是可扩展的

684
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,495
you can put your own objects in here, okay.
你也可以在这里加入自己的对象

685
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,563
Your own things they draw, custom drawing or whatever.
UI上所画的一切你都可以自己控制

686
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,633
And we'll show you all about that as the weeks go by.
过几周我就会给你们展示

687
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,603
All right. So, I have one button here, that's good.
好的，现在我有一个按钮在这，非常好

688
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,171
I could even run my app right now.
我甚至已经可以运行这个app了

689
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,673
So how do I run this application? You
那么我如何运行它呢？

690
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:07,544
go up here to the top, you see where it says iPhone 6s Plus.
看上来，在顶栏这，你能看到这上面写着 “iPhone 6s Plus”

691
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,914
This is actually a list of simulators that you can choose
这实际上是你要选择的模拟器列表

692
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:14,985
to run your app on, all right? So, you could also run it on
来运行你的app，明白了吗？当然你也可以在一个设备上运行它

693
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:18,889
a device. If you connected a device and did that team thing
如果你连接了设备然后配好对

694
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,626
I was talking about, you can run it on your device here but
我现在讲的是，你可以在你的设备上运行app

695
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,460
I didn't connect a device so
但我没有连接任何设备

696
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,529
I'm going to run it on an iPhone 6. Okay, so
所以我打算在 iPhone 6 模拟器上运行它

697
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:30,000
I just pick iPhone 6 and then I just press Play right here,
我只需要选择 iPhone 6 接着按下这个运行键

698
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,969
so we press play it's gonna bring up
好了我们按下运行键，它会产生一个

699
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,571
an iPhone simulator okay and
iPhone模拟器

700
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,206
then the iPhone simulator is gonna run this app.
接着我们的app就会在这个iPhone模拟器上运行

701
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,309
Now this iPhone simulator that you see appearing right here,
现在你看到，这个iPhone模拟器上

702
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,112
it's showing our app. This is more than just our app.
有了我们的app，当然模拟器有的不只是我们的app

703
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:45,649
This is actually a full simulator of the iPhone.
它可以模拟iPhone的各种行为

704
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,485
And in fact, if I go Hardware, Home, that's
实际上，我点击这个 “Hardware”,，“Home”

705
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,221
just like pressing the Home button. You know the little
它就会像真正按在home键上一样，就像

706
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:55,058
Home button on your iPhone? Watch this. Press Home, and
按你iPhone上的 home 键，看，点击home

707
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,227
it goes to here. And I got Settings, Photo,
它就回到主界面，这里就是些设置，相册

708
00:34:57,229 --> 00:35:02,499
Calendar, Safari, other apps, etc. Okay, and here's my app.
日历，Safari，各种app。Okay?这里是我的app

709
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,669
This my assistive app, calculator has no app icon.
这就是我的计算机app，目前还没有一个图标

710
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,038
But, there it is. Now, I can go back. Okay? So
但是看这里，我可以点进去，okay？

711
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,508
it's really simulating the device here. Now,
所以它像一个真正的iPhone

712
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,680
what happens if I touch this button? Nothing. Okay?
那么现在我按下这个按钮会怎样呢？什么都不会发生，okay？

713
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,149
That's because we haven't really taught our
因为当这个按钮按下的时候

714
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:23,487
calculator app what to do when this button is touched. So
我的计算器并不知道该做些什么，我还没有教它

715
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,089
let's go do that. Now how are we gonna do that?
所以我们现在来教它，怎么做呢？

716
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,959
Remember I told you that the V, the view here is kind of
记得我告诉过你们的, MVC 里的 V

717
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,761
generic UI buttons and sliders and that there's a model which
这个按键是一个原生的按键，我们现在还没有

718
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,931
we don't have yet okay? And then there's the controller.
一个 model 来控制它，okay？这是我们的 controller

719
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,968
So the way that touching on buttons causes anything to
按下按按键发生的所有事情都是这个 controller 来完成的

720
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,038
happen is via the controller. So somehow we have to connect
所以我们得把按钮和 controller 连接起来

721
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,542
this button up to our controller. In fact,
所以我们得把按钮和 controller 连接起来

722
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,544
what we wanna do is, when we touch this button,
所以，我现在需要做的，就是当我们按下这个按钮时

723
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:51,882
we wanna invoke a method in our controller object, right?
我们想调用 controller 中的一个方法，好吗？
 
724
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:53,183
Sounds nice and object oriented.
听起来非常面向对象

725
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:56,286
That's what we wanna do. So how do we set that up, okay?
那么我们如何完成这件事呢？

726
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,489
We're gonna set that up by getting the controller and
我们需要把 controller 和 view 放在

727
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,592
the view on screen at the same time. Okay, and
同一个屏幕上，okay？

728
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,362
then we're gonna wire it up graphically with the mouse.
然后我们用鼠标把它们连接起来

729
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,630
So let's get both on there at the same time.
现在我们把它们两个放在屏幕上

730
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,865
The way we do that is with this button right here this
怎么做呢？看见编辑栏右边的

731
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,469
little round circle the assistant editor. This brings
小圈圈了吗？点击它可以

732
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:17,207
up the controller and the view on screen at the same time
把 controller 和 view 放在同一个屏幕上

733
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:20,277
again I have low resolution so it's all kinda smashed so
这个界面现在很小，那么现在关闭

734
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:23,580
let's close our navigator and close our utilities. Okay,
左边和的导航栏和右边的工具栏，okay？

735
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:27,584
and we can share this space however we want. Okay, so
我们可以随便改变，okay？

736
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,251
we have plenty of room for our code.
现在我们有足够的空间展示代码了

737
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:32,589
And here's our controller. So, now this is gonna seem wacky,
这是我们的 controller，这可能看起来会有一点怪异

738
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,591
but it's actually really, really cool. Okay.
但实际上这非常，非常，酷，okay？

739
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,694
The way that we hook up that button, to call a method in
我们现在把按钮和 controller 里的方法连接起来

740
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:41,932
our controller, is by holding down the control key, okay.
只需要按住 control 键

741
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,066
I'm gonna hold down the control key.
好，我现在按住了 control 键

742
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:47,938
And drag, from the button [LAUGH] into my coat, okay.
然后拖动，从按钮拖动到我的代码里来，okay？

743
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,774
Now I know it really seems weird but it's cool, okay.
我知道现在看起来非常怪异，但是也很酷，okay？

744
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,843
So I can put it wherever I want in my class here. And
我可以随意拖动它到我的代码里面

745
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,514
when I let go, it's gonna say okay, what kind of connection
然后当我松开鼠标，需要设置些东西

746
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:00,817
do you wanna make between this user interface object and
比如我们UI对象和 controller 之间

747
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,086
your controller? And there's really two choices,
需要什么样的连接？这里有2个选择

748
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,521
one is called an outlet which I'm gonna talk
一个是调用 “outlet”，这个我稍后再讲

749
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:07,290
about in a moment and the other one is called an action.
另一个叫做 “action”

750
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:10,493
So an action is when you want something that happens in UI
“action” 就是当UI中发生了一些事件后，

751
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,762
to invoke a method in your controller. Okay?
controller 里的方法将被调用，okay？

752
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,999
Exactly what we want here, that's what an action is. So
这就是我们想要的，这就是 “action” 的作用

753
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:18,702
here it's asking the name, it wants to know the name
那么这里需要一个名字，它需要知道这个方法的名字

754
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:22,239
of the method. So here I'm touching a digit button,
因为我需要按下一个按钮

755
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,908
so I'm gonna call this touchDigit. Okay.
所以我这在输入 “touchDigit”，okay？

756
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,910
So this is just the name of the method that,
这就是在我的 controller 里

00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,479
is gonna be created in my controller.
建立的方法的名字

758
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,514
Notice that my method can have arguments.
注意，我的方法可以有参数

759
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,882
You see down here where it says arguments?
你看下面，这里写着 ”Arguments”

760
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:37,053
It could have no arguments. Okay. Which is fine, right.
它可以不需要参数, 没有任何问题。

761
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,622
I don't want an argument, that'd be fine.
我不需要参数，这样设置就好了

762
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,225
It can have one argument which is the sender, in other words,
也可以有一个参数，叫做 sender，换言之

763
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,728
the button that is sending me this method, okay.
这个按钮会把我送到这个方法里来，okay？

764
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,297
That's really valuable argument, okay. Especially in
这是个很有价值的参数，okay？


765
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,033
this case because I'm gonna have a whole bunch of buttons.
特别是当我有很多按键的时候

766
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,235
They're each gonna be sending touch digit, and
每一个案件都会发送一个数字

767
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,336
I wanna know which one sent it to me.
我会想知道哪个按键发送给我了信息

768
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,506
So the fact that it's gonna pass itself as an argument to
事实上，按键会把它自己当作参数

769
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,843
this method is great. The only problem is if you see this
传递给方法，有个问题就是

770
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:03,246
type right here any object. That's going to be the type
你看见这里有一个 “any object”，它的类型就是一个 object

771
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,982
of the object. It's this generic any [LAUGH] object
它可以是右边任意类型的对象

772
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,184
thing right here. We don't want that. Okay?
我们不需要，okay？

773
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:12,522
So when you're doing your homework don't miss this step.
当你做家庭作业的时候，不要错过这一步

774
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:17,527
Okay? Change this from any object to UI button.
okay？把它从 “any object” 改成 “UIButton”

775
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:20,630
Because of course the thing sending us this message is UI
因为发送给我们消息的显然是一个 UIbutton

776
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,833
button. It's unfortunate that this is not the default but
不幸的是它不是默认设置

777
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,304
you must do this. Okay? So, this I wanna click Connect,
所以你必须自己搞定，okay？现在，我来点击 “Connect”

778
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:30,440
this is just what event is causing this a touch on
这是按下按键后会触发的事件

779
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:34,277
the button that goes up inside the buttons bounds. Okay?
按键会重新“弹起来”
 
780
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,046
So I'm gonna hit connect right here and
所以我现在点击一下
781
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:37,614
it's gonna write the code for a method.
它会写下这个方法的代码
782
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:40,917
You're gonna see your first Swift method here we go. Okay?
你会在这里看到第一个 swift 方法，okay？

783
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:44,354
This is your first Swift method. Now this is actually
这是你的第一个 swift 方法

784
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,923
not part of Swift. Okay, it's not part of this method.
这里不是 swift 的一部分，okay？它不是方法的一部分

785
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,659
This is something Xcode puts in here. So that this little
这是 Xcode 放在这里的东西

786
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,996
round circle appears. You see that round circle right there?
所以这里有一个小圈圈，你看了这个小圈圈了吗？

787
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,764
If I mouse over that round circle,
如果我把鼠标放上去

788
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:59,502
you see how it shows me what thing in my view is hooked up
你可以看见，方法和UI里的东西是怎样连接的
789
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,072
to this method you see? Okay so that's what this is so
看见了吗？ 这就是它的作用
790
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:06,242
that's really not part of the Swift method. Okay so this is
它不是 swift 方法的一部分

791
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,547
all the Swift method. Okay so what is Swift method syntax?
这才是 swift 里的方法，okay？swift 的方法语法是怎样的呢？

792
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:14,184
Func, okay, func means this is a function on a class,
先是一个func，func 代表的是这个类里的一个函数

793
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,420
a method is essentially a function on a class, right?
方法本质上就是类里的函数，好吗？

794
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:21,858
I suppose this could be called Method. Like the breaking bad
这可以被叫做方法。

795
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,261
version of what you'll call meth maybe. But func is good,
和《绝命毒师》里的冰毒发音类似，但是 func 是好的

796
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,631
func is good because you can have global funcs also.
func 还好在你还可以写全局函数

797
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:32,335
Okay, you can have the same syntax outside of a class,
使用同样的语法，你可以在类的外面写一个函数

798
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,871
description outside of these braces.
定义在这些大括号的外面

799
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,306
And it will be a global function.
这样它就是个全局函数

800
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:37,540
And we're gonna see some of those.
我们之后会见到一些全局函数

801
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,042
Like square root is a function I'm gonna
就像平方根函数

802
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,345
use when I add square root to my calculator. All right, so
比如，当我在计算器里加上根号的时候

803
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,748
that's the key words just like class is the key word for
“class”，这是创建一个类的的关键字

804
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,684
creating a class. Func is the key word for adding a method.
“func” 是添加一个方法的关键字

805
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:52,155
Touch digit is the name, obviously of this method.
“touchDight” 是它的名字，显然它是一个方法

806
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,691
Parentheses has the arguments, okay?
括号内可以有参数

807
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:58,561
We only have one argument called sender of type
我们只有一个叫做 “sender” 的参数

808
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:02,599
UIButton, so that's what : UIButton means.
类型是 UIButton， 这就是 UIButton 的意思

809
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:06,102
Any time you're defining a type of something in Swift,
当你在swift定义一个东西的类型的时候

810
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,838
colon and the type after the name of the thing.
使用冒号，后面跟着它需要的类型的名字

811
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,807
Okay, and that's true for arguments to methods,
方法中的参数也是这样

812
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,609
it's also true for local variables, everything.
局部变量，所有东西，都是这样

813
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,812
Colon and the type, okay? Now if we had more arguments,
冒号，然后类型名字，okay？现在如果我们有多个参数

814
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:20,617
they would just be separated by comma, like otherArgument
它们应该被逗号分隔开，如同这个 otherArgument

815
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:24,654
might be an Int, okay, so I put an Int there.
它可以是一个Int， okay？所以我写一个 Int 在这

816
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,990
So, this is another argument, second argument here, and
所以这是第二个参数

817
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,926
I can have as many as I want, and they each have to have
我需要多少个参数都可以，每一个都需要一个参数名

818
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:34,030
a key word, which describes, what they are. If this had
来表示它们是干什么的

819
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:39,068
a return value, it looks like this. Returns String. Okay, or
如果这个方法有返回值，就这样写，返回一个 String

820
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,938
returns Double. Okay, something like that.
或者返回一个 Double, okay?就像这样

821
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,809
That's how a return looks like, okay. Now I'm gonna
return 就这样写，okay？

822
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,445
take a timeout here from writing our calculator and
现在我要开始写我们的计算器了

823
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,180
just show you what its like to call a method.
教你如何调用一个方法

824
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,916
Okay? This is we're declaring the method. What if I wanted
Okay? 我们在这里声明了一个方法

825
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,919
to call this method on myself? Okay it would be recursive
如果我自己想调用这个方法呢？那么就会出现递归

826
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,887
here because I'm inside touched as your butt.
因为这是自己调用自己

827
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,089
I just wanna show you the syntax for calling okay?
我只是展示一下调用方法的语法

828
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,325
So if I want to send something to myself.
如果我想给我自己发送点信息

829
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,495
I use the key word self, and then to send a message it's
我用关键字 “self”，然后发送信息

830
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,298
just like Java you press dot, okay?
如果JAVA一样，按下“.”，okay？

831
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,333
The thing you want to send it to dot and
你想发送什么，按下一个“.”

832
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:14,504
then you type the name of the method or of the property if
然后输入你需要调用的方法或属性

833
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:17,207
you wanna access an instance variable exactly the same.
如果你想调用一个实例变量，也是相同的办法

834
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:17,740
The name of the property or
对某个对象，你想调用的属性的名字

835
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:20,043
the method that you wanna access in that object.
或者方法的名字

836
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,645
So here I want to do touchDigit and you're going
在这我想调用 touchDigit

837
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,014
to notice here that Xcode is helping me a lot as I type,
你会发现 Xcode 会帮助我输入

838
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,817
it's giving me lists of things that I can choose that
给我一张列表供我选择

839
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,987
are likely. Here touchDigit, it's putting that on the top
这里，touchDigit，在最顶上

840
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,356
cuz that's the only method that is in my class.
因为这是这个类中的唯一的方法

841
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,092
I inherit a lot of methods from my superclasses but
我从父类中继承了非常多的方法

842
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,862
this is the only one in my class and in fact if I just
但这是这个类中的唯一的方法，事实上

843
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,531
press Tab, it starts filling it out. I'm not even,
如果我按下 Tab，它会自动补全，不需要全部手打

844
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,167
I don't even have to type it okay, cuz it knows that's what
因为 Xcode 知道我们想要什么

845
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:48,771
I want. Now, it takes two argument. The first argument
现在它有两个参数

846
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,508
you just put it in. So the first argument was a button so
这里的第一个参数是一个 button， 所以

847
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,078
maybe, you know, some button or something like that. Okay,
我输入 someButton 之类的东西，okay

848
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,446
some variable that would have to be a button.
某些变量会是一个 button

849
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:59,115
I don't have one but that's what it would be.
现在我没有这个变量，不过以后会有的

850
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,783
The second argument here, okay, and
这里的第二个参数

851
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:03,753
I'm just hitting Tab to go to each argument, is an Int,
我按了 Tab 键来跳到每个参数，它是一个 Int

852
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,256
so let's say I put 5, okay, so this is how I would
那么我放一个5在这里，okay，我就打算这么做了

853
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,958
call this thing. Now what's interesting about this is,
现在，有趣的事

854
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,662
notice that this keyword is actually included,
注意这个关键字也出现了

855
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:15,532
in other languages this would look like this. All right?
在其它语言中会是这个样子，All right?

856
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,934
You would just have the two arguments, sender and
你只需要两个参数，sender 和 argument

857
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:22,272
argument, but here in Swift, sorry, in Swift,
但是在 swift 里

858
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:27,844
we put the explicit, name of the argument here for
需要非常详尽，参数名也需要写出来

859
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,680
readability and clarity except for we don't do it with
这是为了可读，清晰，但我们不写第一个参数的参数名

860
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:35,151
the first one. Okay? The first one we don't do.
okay？不要写第一个参数的参数名

861
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:37,620
That's because usually the first one is implicit in
因为 swift 里通常都这样做

862
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:41,758
the name, okay? But, that's what, now there is a way to
okay？非得写出这个参数名的话

863
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,394
make it so you have to do the first one, for but generally
也是有一个方法的，但是最好别这样做

864
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,729
we don't. In other words we don't type sender this.
换言之不要把 sender 写出来

865
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,598
And in fact, it's wrong to type sender that.
事实上，这样做是错误的

866
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,967
>> Would that be an error?
这样会造成错误吗？

867
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:51,000
>> It would be an error.
是的，这会造成错误

868
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:55,705
It would not compile. Okay? So that's the syntax for sending.
它不会编译，okay？这就是发送一个消息的语法了

869
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,041
And you'll have to get used to putting these in for
你们会逐渐习惯这样的写法

870
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,944
all the subsequent arguments besides the first.
除了第一个，其他的参数都要写参数名

871
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:04,447
Okay. So let's gret rid of all this stuff we added. So
okay，删掉这些我们加上的东西

872
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:08,084
here's our touchDigit. let's just have touchDigit
这是我们的 touchDigit，现在让它

873
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,587
print something out to the console. Okay?
打印个什么，输出到控制台里，okay？

874
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,621
Great thing to know for debugging, and
这是 debug 的好方法，什么的

875
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:14,958
stuff like that. You do that with the method print. And
在方法里写上打印语句

876
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,026
I'm just going to say, print touchDigit.
我打印一个 “touchDigit”

877
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:19,562
So it's gonna print touchDigit after the console.
它会在控制台里打印一个 “touchDigit” 出来

878
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:22,899
Notice no semicolons on the end of lines or anything like
注意，句尾没有分号或其他东西

879
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:27,270
that. In Swift the carriage return is the end of line.
swift 里，回车表示这一行的结束

880
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,072
And if you wanna put two statements on the same line
如果你想把两条语句打在一行里

881
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,440
you can use a semicolon in between, but
在语句中间加上分号就行了

882
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:34,077
generally the carriage return is the end of line, okay? So
但一般情况，我们用回车作为语句结尾，okay？

883
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,046
we print touch digit here. Let's go ahead and run and
所以把 print 语句写在这

884
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:45,188
see if that works. Changes our simulator.
现在运行一下看它是否能正常工作，改变下我们的模拟器

885
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,955
Now, where is the console?
现在，控制台在哪里？

886
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,258
It's going to appear magically at the bottom here as soon as
当有东西出现在控制台里的时候

887
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,060
something appears on the console. So, here we go.
它会神器地从底部出现，所以，here we go

888
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:55,164
Ready? 5, there it is. There's the console in here. 5 again,
Ready? 5, 它出来了，这就是控制台，再按一下，5

889
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,800
okay we got two of them. Okay, we press a whole bunch of
okay，我们现在有2个5了

890
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,403
times, and get a whole bunch of them. Go back here, scroll
我们按几次5它就出现几次，回到这里来

891
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:04,507
around. This bottom area has the console on the right,
滚动一下，底部区域里，右边是控制台

892
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:07,944
and your debugger output on the left. This is where when
左边是调试器，debug 的时候你会用到

893
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,712
we start to do debugging you'll see it on the left.
它会出现在左边

894
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:13,416
You can hide one or the other, like we could hide our
也可以隐藏它们，我们可以隐藏调试器

895
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,252
debugger and just see our console here. Okay, so
只留下我们的控制台，okay？

896
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,222
this is cool, this is great. Except for we're gonna
这很酷，非常棒

897
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:23,292
have a lot of buttons not just this one button, this 5.
但是如果有一堆按键而不是一个呢？这是个5

898
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:26,195
Okay, so let's go back to our UI. By the way you can hide
现在回到我们的UI，顺便说一下

899
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,565
this thing by either dragging it down or pressing this
你可以通过拖拽来隐藏它们，或者点击这个按钮

900
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,935
button up here. Okay, just like you hide this thing
就像你点击这个隐藏这个

901
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:36,105
with that you hide with this with that. All right, so we'll
就像你点击这个隐藏这个

902
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:39,509
stop. Now I wanna make a whole keypad worth of buttons here.
停止运行，现在我想做出一个完整的键盘

903
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,611
Instead of just having a 5, I want a whole bunch.
不只是一个5，而是所有数字

904
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:42,979
So I'm gonna do that with copy and paste.
我通过复制粘贴来完成

905
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:47,550
Copy, paste okay? There we go, paste another one here.
复制，粘贴，okay？好了，再粘贴一个

906
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:51,387
Okay? Maybe this is our 4, 5 and 6.
okay？这个是我们的4，5，6

907
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:55,525

1, 2, and 3 and may you paste again.
1，2，3，然后再粘贴一次

909
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:05,635
Go up here. 7, 8, 9 and we'll copy and
移到上面来，7，8，9，再复制

910
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:11,407
paste one more to make our 0. Okay?
粘贴出我们的0，okay？

911
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:15,511
So here's our nice little keypad right here. And,
这就是我们的小键盘了

912
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:20,583
now we can run. And we'll notice
现在我们运行它

913
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:24,287
that all of these buttons are sending touch digit. You see?
注意所有的按键都会发送信息给 touchDigit

914
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,055
Okay, so they're all sending touch digit.
他们都会发送信息给 touchDigit

915
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,991
Which is good, that's kind of nice. We can also tell they're
很棒，很不错，我们还能通过这个小圈圈

916
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,259
all sending it with this little circle.
看到它们连接在一起

917
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,395
Watch what happens when I mouse over. You see?
看看我移开鼠标会发生什么？看见了吗？

00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,898
It's selecting them all to say they're all sending it. Okay.
选中了全部按键，他们都能发送信息

919
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,169

但，我们需要知道是那一个按键发送了信息，okay

920
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,472
So we're gonna have to look at this sender argument,
所以我们需要看看这个 sender 参数

921
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:45,775
to see which button is sending us this touch digit.
看看是哪个按键发给它了信息

922
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:48,511
Okay. So I'm gonna create a local variable here.
okay，我打算建立一个局部变量

923
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:51,714
This is how you create a local variable, var. The name,
这就是如何建立一个局部变量，var，然后是变量名

924
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:55,451
which I'm gonna call digit. And I'm gonna set it equal to,
我打算叫它 digit，我打算把它设置成

925
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:59,522
whatever I get from asking the sender, what its title is.
给被按下的按键的数字，按键的名字

926
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:02,658
Okay? Now, how do I do that? Well, we know that we
okay？怎么做呢？ 我们知道

927
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,229
send a message to something by doing the object, right,
得到这个名字肯定和sender这个对象有关，对吗？

928
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:11,434
sender and a dot, okay? Unfortunately, button has, mm,
sender 然后一个“.”，okay？不幸的是
929
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:15,471
quite a few methods, okay? I mean probably hundreds, okay?
按键拥有很多方法，okay？可能几百个，okay？

930
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,808
Because it's inheriting things from control and view and
因为它继承于 control，view

931
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:18,875
stuff like that.
类似的东西

932
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,978
So it's a pretty much, a bummer trying to find out how
所以找到按键名似乎还是很困难

933
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,681
to know what to give this. So we need documentation here.
所以我们在这种时候

934
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:28,184
We need some help, okay. So the way to do that

937
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:35,792
dragging between your view and your thing. Now Option is
特别是对UI拖拽来说，现在 option 键

938
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:38,194
an important key. And when you hold down Option,
也非常重要，当你按下 option 键

939
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:40,029
look what happens when you mouse over things.
再移动鼠标，看看会发生什么

940
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:43,900
They get this dash blue underline going. And what that
下方出现了蓝色虚线，这意味着

941
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:46,536
means is if you click on them Xcode's gonna tell you
如果你点击了它们，Xcode 会告诉你

942
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:49,705
as much as it can about that thing. So let's click on

943
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:53,309
UIButton and when we do we get this little window that
UIButton 这点击，我们得到了一个小窗口
944
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:57,547
has a complete description of UIButton in here. And really
它拥有关于 UIButton 完整信息，非常重要的是

945
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:01,150
importantly down at the bottom it has a reference link.
在最底下，有一个引用链接

946
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,686
See this reference link? And if I click this, this is gonna
看见这个引用链接了吗？如果我点它一下

947
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:07,757
take me to the documentation for UIButton. So there we go.
它会把我带到 UIButton 的文档里，所以我们点击它

948
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,226
Here it is, UIButton. Here's all the methods and
这就是了，UIButton，这是它所有的方法

00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:26,375
Now, I need to find something about the title so
现在，我要找出关于 ”title”(标题) 的一些信息

953
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:29,846
I could search here by just doing Cmd+f to search, and
我可以按下Cmd+f进行搜索

954
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:32,982
I could search for title but unfortunately the title
我可以搜索一下 “title”，不幸的是

955
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:37,286
is mentioned a lot, see? So that's no good. So
“title” 在文档里被提及的太多了，很不好

956
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,522
I can go over here to the summary of all the methods and
然后我可以看下 summary 这里，它有所有的方法和属性

957
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,792
properties. We could look here. Getting dimensions,
我们可以看过来，看看它包括些什么

958
00:47:42,794 --> 00:47:46,128
no I don't wanna do that. Configuring edge insets we
不，我不想这样做，我们甚至还不知道什么是

959
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,998
don't even know what that is yet. Getting the current state
“Configuring edge insets”，“获取目前状态”这个听起来

960
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,700
that sounds pretty good, getting the current state.
还不错，获取目前状态
961
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:53,302
Let's see what we've got, button type okay here's how I
看看这里有什么？按键类型，okay，它在这

962
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:54,670
can get the button's type that's good.
我现在可以得到按键的类型了，不错

963
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:58,741
Current title, the current title displayed on the button,
“Current title”，按键上的名称

964
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:00,643
victory, that's what we want. Okay,
胜利了！这就是我们要的，okay？

965
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,012
now when we find something in the documentation we want,
现在，当我们需要在文档中找东西时

966
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:06,115
you're gonna see that there is a Swift explanation
你可以看见这里有关于swift解释

967
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:08,918
of it, and and objective C explanation. So we're always
或者关于 Objective C 的解释

968
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,021
going to be looking at the Swift version in this class.
我们看看这个类的解释的 swift 版本

969
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:13,322
So what is this thing, okay?
这是个什么？

970
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:16,926
This is not a method because it would say func right here.
它不是一个方法，因为方法前面有一个 “func”

971
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:19,595
If this were a method on UIButton you would have func.
如果它是 UIButton 里的方法，你会看到一个 ”func”

972
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:22,265
Instead it has var, that means it's a property.
但这有一个 “var”，意味着它是一个属性

973
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:25,034
So a property's like an instance variable, okay?
属性就像一个实例变量，okay？

974
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:27,436
Now this is an interesting property because it's got this
这是个有趣的属性

975
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:31,908
little terminology on the end, which means it's read only. So
因为在末尾有个这个东西，意味着它是只读的

976
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,877
we can't set the button's title here with current title.
所以我们不能通过它来设置这个按键的名称

977
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,413
Turns out that's because there's another method up here
但是呢还有一个方法

978
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,750
called setTitle forState for setting the button's title.
叫 “setTitle forState“ 来设置按键的名称
979
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:41,884
Because when you set the button's title,
因为当你设置一个按键名称的时候

980
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,320
you wanna set the title for what state it's in,
你需要知道这个按键的状态

981
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,589
highlighted, disabled, whatever. But luckily there's
高亮？禁用？无所谓

982
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,493
a current title here that just gets you the current title.
幸运的是这里有一个 “current title” 让你获取当前按键名称

983
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,995
In whatever state the button is currently in.
不管这个按键当前是什么状态的

984
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,998
So, here is, so that's why it says var instead of func.
这就是这为什么是 var 而不是 func

985
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,635
Here's the name of the property, currentTitle.
这里是属性的名字，currentTitle

986
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,436
Here is the type.
这里是它的类型

987
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,906
I promised you that it was always colon and type. Now,
我向你保证类型前总是有一个冒号

988
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:09,011
the type of this is string? >> [LAUGH]
现在这个类型是 String??

989
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:11,614
>> Wha? Maybe. Okay? We're
啥？可能是吧，okay

990
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,984
gonna suspend our disbelief here because that question
现在刹住你们的疑问，因为这个问号

991
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:18,721
mark actually means something. We're gonna kinda hope that
意味着些什么，我们希望这是一个 string

992
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:22,158
this is a string, but it's not going to be. But that's okay.
但它不是，不过没有关系

993
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,860
So we're gonna try and assume it is. All right? So anyway,
我们就假设它是，好吗？

994
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,495
this is how we look things up in the documentation
无论如何，这就在文档里如何找东西的办法

995
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:30,199
to see the way it works. Now, there's another way to do it,
现在，也有其他办法来做这事

996
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,468
okay, which is even cooler. I type this dot.
更酷一点，我输入这个”.”

997
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,538
I want the title so I'm just going to start typing title.
我想使用”title”，所以我就继续输入”title”

998
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,840
Okay I don't know there is a method called title,
okay，我不知道这里是否有一个方法，名字是title

999
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,843
in fact there isn't. But as soon as I started typing title
事实上是没有的，但只要我输入完之后

1000
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:43,346
it shows me all the methods that start with title.
它会告诉我所有以 “title” 开头的方法的名字

1001
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:48,617
All the methods that include title in the name. See?
所有名字里包含了title的方法，看见了吗？

1002
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:54,156
And all the methods that have T-I-T-L-E in the order. Okay,
还有所有含有T-I-T-L-E这个字母顺序的方法

1003
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,093
and it gives it to you in the order you might expect right?
这会按照你期望的顺序呈现

1004
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:00,363
Title first and then. So this is kinda helping,
含有title这个词的优先，别的在后面，这提供了一种帮助

1005
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:00,997
you can search basically.
你可以这么搜索

1006
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,599
And when you do this you would quickly see current title,
当你这么做的时候，你快速浏览到currenttitle

1007
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,769
that looks like what I want. And you can double click here,
这看起来像是我想要的。你就在这双击

1008
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,138
actually, and it will put in there. Okay? So
这样就会出现在这里。

1009
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,942
there's our current title. Now instead of printing touch
这就是我们要的currenttitle。

1010
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:17,313
digit we basically wanna print which one, which digit was,
现在我们想打印具体按到的某个数字，而不是“touchDigit”

1011
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:22,485
touched here. So I'm gonna say touched, we could say percent,
所以这里要换成

1012
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,254
s digit. Comma digit.
“touched %s digit”, digit

1013
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,790
This is what it would look like in C. For example,
这就看起来像是C语音

1014
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:31,327
is everyone familiar with this print F like format?
所以你们对printf熟悉吗

1015
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,696
Okay good, cuz you can't do it in Swift.
很好，但你不能在Swift里这样做

1016
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,096
Okay. >> [LAUGH]

1017
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,164
>> We don't do that in Swift.
我们在Swift里不这么做

1018
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,633
Instead, we do backslash, open parentheses,
我们用反斜杠、括号代替

1019
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,903
close parentheses. And then we can put anything we want in
然后里面放任何我们想放的

1020
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:43,806
here. Okay clean digit. And we don't need this out here on
删掉digit，引号外不需要它

1021
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:47,510
the side. Okay, so this will be invaluated converted to
所以这会被转换成string类型

1022
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:50,279
a string. Some things can't be converted to strings but
有的不能被转换，但大多数可以

1023
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:53,215
most things can, so you put that in there. Okay,
所以你可以把它放在里面

1024
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,652
if you can't you'll get a warning, okay? All right, so
如果不可以，你会被警告

1025
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,054
that's how we do that. So, let's go ahead and
所以我们就这么做了

1026
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:01,357
see what's going on. But now maybe we should start paying
继续看看接下来会发生什么

1027
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,024
attention to our warnings.
我想现在应该开始注意一下这个警告了

1028
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:05,428
Okay, when you submit your homework, no warnings please.
当你们交作业的时候，不准有警告

1029
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,463
Okay, no warnings. And certainly no errors,
没有警告，当然也不能有错误

1030
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:10,433
those are red things those won't build, no warnings. So
有错误的时候就不能build

1031
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,535
what is this warning, let's take a look at this warning.
这个警告是什么呢？我们来看看

1032
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:14,170
You look at a warning by clicking on it.
我们通过点击来看一个警告

1033
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:16,572
So I'm gonna click on it, and it says here,
我点击他，这里是这么写的

1034
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:21,644
variable digit with never mutated, consider changing to
digit这个变量没有被改变过

1035
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:26,082
let constant. Okay, what does that mean?
是不是考虑把他变成let型常量。这是什么意思呢？

1036
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:31,020
That means that instead of var here, it wants us to put let.
这里的意思是，希望我们用let而不是var

1037
00:51:31,022 --> 00:51:34,623
And in fact, you should always do that. Anytime you declare
事实上我们应该这么做

1038
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,793
a local variable, okay, or even a property that is
任何时候申明一个本地变量，或者一个属性

1039
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,629
initialized at the beginning and never changes, in other
在初始化后就一直没被改变，换句话说，

1040
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:43,599
words, it's a constant, use let instead of var.
就是个常量，我们就应该用let而不是var

1041
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,268
Now why do you want to do that? Two reasons really, one,
那么我们现在为什么要这么做？两个理由

1042
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,804
it helps people reading your code realize this thing's
一、这帮助别人读你的代码的时候意识到

1043
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,040
never going to change, I don't have to worry about it,
这个一直不会变，不需要去担心它

1044
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:54,243
it's just like a constant. And two, if that thing were for
这只是个常量。二、如果那个东西，

1045
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:57,613
example, an array, or a dictionary, and you use let,
比如说是一个数组或者字典，你用了let

1046
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,883
that means nothing can be put into that dictionary or
这就意味着没有什么可以放进字典或从字典拿出

1047
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:04,553
taken out. Or into the array or taken out okay. So
也可以放进数组或从数组拿出

1048
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:08,023
it's how you can create read only arrays and dictionaries
这就是你如何创建只读的数组或者是字典

1049
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:12,628
okay. So, always use let when you are doing a constant.
所以申明常量的时候一定记得用let

1050
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,563
And in fact notice that XCode is saying,
注意Xcode这里说的

1051
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,733
hey if you click here I'll fix it for you. Okay,
如果你点这里，我会为你修复这个问题

1052
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:21,904
see how it says fix it replays var with let. Sure. Okay, and
看一下它如何用let代替var修正这个问题

1053
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:24,773
it did it and now the warnings gone. Okay, so
所以它做到了，警告没了

1054
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:29,678
let's run, see if this is working. We're crossing our
来跑一下，看看是不是能行

1055
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,915
fingers about that whole string question mark thing.
我们越过我们的手指关于整串问号的事情

1056
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:35,518
All right, so here we go, let's press 5.
好了，来按下5

1057
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,189
The heck is going on down there? Okay, touched
这下面就会显示数字

1058
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:45,294
optional 5 digit? Okay so what is this optional business.
touched optional("5") digit？这里的optional是什么

1059
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,163
Here you all wanna take a deep breath,
所以这里你们得深呼吸

1060
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:50,332
clear your minds, and pay close attention okay. Because
清空你们的脑袋，集中全部注意力

1061
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,935
this is a very important thing in Swift, it's ubiquitous
因为这是Swift里非常非常重要的东西

1062
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:57,740
throughout the entire iOS API okay. Very cool feature, but
这在iOS API里无处不在，一个非常酷的特性

1063
00:52:57,742 --> 00:53:00,442
it requires a little bit of getting used to in terms of
但是需要一段时间来熟悉这个语法

1064
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:05,381
its syntax okay? This is the feature of optionals. Okay?
这是一个叫optional的特性

1065
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:09,818
In Swift, there is a type called optional.
在Swift里，有一种类型叫optional

1066
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,388
It's a type like int or boolean or anything else,
这是一种类似于int或bool的类型

1067
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,323
string, it's dictionary, array,
或者是string、dictionary、array这样的

1068
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:18,360
optional. Optional is just a type. This type can only have
optional只是一个类型，这个类型只有两个值

1069
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:23,699
two values. One value is not set. Okay?
一个值是没有被赋值

1070
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:28,070
That's expressed in Swift with the key word nil, N-I-L.
在Swift里表示它的关键字是nil

1071
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:31,473
Nil only means, this optional is not set.
nil只表示optional没有被赋值

1072
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:33,709
That's all it means in Swift. It doesn't mean zero.
这就是他在Swift里全部的含义，这不代表它为零

1073
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,245
It doesn't mean a pointer that doesn't point anywhere, like
这不像别的语言，它不代表一个不指向任何地方的指针

1074
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:39,882
in other languages. Nil means an optional that's not set.
nil代表一个optional没有被赋值

1075
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:45,120
The other state that an optional can be is set,
另一个状态就是一个optional被赋值了

1076
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:48,691
okay? Now, if it's in the set state, it can have
如果它在被赋值状态

1077
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:52,995
an associated value, okay? An associated value,
他就可以有一个关联值

1078
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:55,698
which can be of any other type, okay? Actually it also
一个可以是其他任何类型的关联值

1079
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,199
could also be an optional. You can have an optional,
实际上，它还可以是一个optional。你可以有一个optional(optional)

1080
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:00,970
optional, but that associated value is just associated with
但是关联值只和它赋值的状态关联

1081
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:03,405
this set state, okay? In the not set state,
在未赋值状态

1082
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,375
there is no associated value cuz it's not set. Okay?
它就没有关联值，因为它没有被赋值

1083
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,011
Now what does it look like to declare it optional? Well,
那么把它申明为optional看起来是什么样呢？

1084
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:12,615
let's go back with our option key and take a look at current
让我们回过头看一下我们的option key看一下currentTitle

1085
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:15,017
title. Okay, you remember this from the documentation?
还记得这段文档吗？

1086
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:20,289
It says var currentTitle string? That means this is
这里写到var currentTitle: string?

1087
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:25,694
an optional whose associated value is a string. Okay?
这里的意思是这是个关联值为string的optional

1088
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:28,063
So if someone looks at this property and
所以如果有人看到这个属性

1089
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:29,198
says, what type is that property?
当他问这个是什么类型的时候

1090
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,701
And they say, it's a string but it's optional no, no.
他可能会说，这是个string，但是是optional。不！

1091
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,973
This is an optional and it's associated values of string,
这是个optional，他的关联值是string

1092
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:42,311
okay? Get used to saying, this type is optional, okay? So
要习惯于说这个类型是optional

1093
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:45,114
this is an optional string, that's what would say.
这是个optional string，这才是正确的

1094
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,516
It's an optional string, okay? But primarily,
这是个optional string。主要是个optional

1095
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:51,053
it's an optional. Okay, it's associated value is a string.
关联值是string

1096
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:53,922
So this currentTitle, why is it an optional? Well,
所以这个currentTitle为什么是个optional？

1097
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:58,560
because we might have a button here that has no title set.
这是因为一个按钮的标题可能不会被赋值

1098
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:02,064
Not set. Okay, so the title needs to be an optional,
没有赋值，所以它应该是个optional

1099
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:05,367
so it can represent the case where it's not set. Now,
所以它就可以表示没有被赋值的情况

1100
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,304
anything can be an optional. Not just pointers, or objects.
所以任何东西都可以是optional。不只是指针或对象

1101
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:11,440
Ints could be optional. You could have an optional int,
int可以是optional，你可以有一个optional int

1102
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:15,077
okay? But here we are representing the title,
但这里我们代表了一个标题

1103
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,414
the button, which is the string and it might be not set
这个按钮的标题是个string，这可能不会被赋值

1104
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,382
okay? So we need that to be an optional.
我们需要这个是个optional

1105
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:23,519
So how do I get the string, because I don't want
所以我怎么得到这个string

1106
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:27,690
this digit, which currently is also an optional string?
我不希望这个digit，现在还是个optional string

1107
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:30,559
Isn't it kinda weird here when I said let digit equal,
当这里是let digit ＝ 的时候不是很奇怪吗
1108
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:34,029
nobody said how come you didn't say colon string?
没人觉得你为什么不加上:string呢？

1109
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:37,900
Okay? I didn't say the type. I declared a local variable.
我没有说类型，我申明一个本地变量

1110
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,170
It didn't even have a type. How was that possible?
我甚至都没有一个类型，这怎么可能？

1111
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:46,742
In Swift, Swift will infer the type all the time, okay? If
在Swift里，Swift会一直推断类型

1112
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,411
it's possible for it to know the type it will infer it.
如果它可以在这里知道他的类型，那么就会推断这个类型

1113
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:54,183
And in fact it's wrong really bad coding style to put that
实际上，这里写上类型是个非常差的编程风格

1114
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:58,220
type in there. It's better to just say let digit equal and
这里最好就这么写

1115
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:01,190
let swift infer it. And here Swift has inferred.
让Swift来推断他的类型。这里Swift也做到了

1116
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,325
The digit must be of type string question mark,
这里的digit一定会是个string?类型

1117
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,228
that's because this is of type string question mark.
因为后面的也是个string?类型

1118
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,365
So of course digit has to be that. You see what's happening
所以digit当然也应该是那个类型。你看到那发生什么了吗？

1119
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,668
there? So you're going to see type inference all the time in
Swift里你会时时看到类型推断的结果

1120
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,203
Swift, it makes your code much more compact,
这让你代码更加简洁

1121
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:18,374
a lot less repeated stuff, is that a question in the back?
很多更少重复的工作，那边的同学有问题吗？

1122
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,875
>> Yeah, is that the same for
这对var是一样的吗？

1123
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:20,209
var too. >> Is the question is
问题是：

1124
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,277
that same for var too, absolutely it's the same for
这对var是一样的吗？

1125
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:26,382
var, okay? So, how do I get that string though?
完全一样。所以我怎么获得那个string呢？

1126
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,951
If this button title is set, how do I get that
如果这个按钮的标题已经有了，那我如何

1127
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:32,721
associated value thing, okay, out of this optional?
从这个optional里面获取这个关联值？

1128
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,525
And the answer is you put an exclamation point in the end,
方法是你在最后放一个感叹号

1129
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,328
okay. Now, optional is question mark on the end of
optional在定义的末尾有个问号

1130
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,831
a declaration. Exclamation point is unwrap this thing and
感叹号是用来unwarp（解包）这个optional

1131
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:46,402
give me the associative value. So this is very succinct,
然后给我这个关联值。这是很简明的

1132
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:50,038
one character for each side of you using this, okay?
每次可以使用一种符号

1133
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,774
Question. >> Can you briefly talk about
问题：

1134
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:52,074
why you want the title to,

1135
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,976
why you design the title to be optional instead of like

1136
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:59,114
an empty string? >> Okay, so the question is,
问题是

1137
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:02,384
why does Swift have this optional thing instead of just
为什么Swift不直接用空字符

1138
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:05,120
doing empty string to mean a button without a title?
而是用optional来表示一个没有标题的button？

1139
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:10,492
Or maybe for an int minus 1. I don't know. Or for a point or
或者是一个最小为1的int

1140
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:14,463
0 memory address or something like that. The main reason for
又或者是一个指针、一个不占内存的地址或者类似的什么东西

1141
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:18,100
that is for example, pointers to objects in Swift, you don't
这主要的原因是，Swift里的指针

1142
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:21,703
see the memory address. So you couldn't have it be 0, okay,
你是看不见内存地址的。所以你不能让他为0

1143
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,906
that's hidden from you. So there'd be no way to do it.
这对你是隐藏的。所以没法这样做

1144
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:28,076
For an int, if you wanted an optional int, is it minus 1 or
对于int，如果你想要一个optional int

1145
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,280
0, max int? What is it, it don't know what it is.
它到底是1？是0？还是别的什么？他不知道应该是多少。

1146
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:34,817
So Swift is trying to be consistent across all things.
所以Swift想涵盖所有情况

1147
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:38,854
Ints, pointers to objects, whatever to make sure that
Ints，指向对象的指针

1148
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,456
we can tell which ones are not set. Okay, so
无论是什么，要保证我们能知道他有没有被赋值

1149
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,591
that's the thought behind it. It's really great actually,
这就是optional背后的思考，非常棒

1150
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:46,094
once you get used to it it's fantastic. All right, so
一旦你习惯这种做法，真的非常赞

1151
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,830
we unwrap it with this exclamation point.
我们用感叹号对它进行unwarp

1152
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:51,767
Now what would happen if that current title value was
如果这里的currentTitle没有被赋值，会发生什么？

1153
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,903
not set? And this exclamation point tried to pull out
这个感叹号试着去把值取出来

1154
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,873
the associated value? What do you think would happen?
你觉得会发生什么

1155
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:58,674
>> Error.
错误

1156
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:00,576
>> Error, yeah, bad error.
错误，是的大错特错

1157
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:02,644
It would crash my app, okay? So
这会让你的应用崩溃

1158
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,247
exclamation point crashes your app if you tried to
如果你试着unwarp一个没有被赋值的optional

1159
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:08,750
unwrap an optional that's in the not set state, okay,
感叹号会让你的应用崩溃

1160
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:12,921
if it's nil. Now some of you conservative folks might be
如果它为空。有些保守的人会说

1161
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:15,257
saying I'm never using exclamation point, that's so
他从来不用感叹号

1162
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:18,927
easy to crash my app. Okay? And the answer to that is yes
因为太容易让应用崩溃。但答案是

1163
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:22,498
it is, but sometimes crashing your app is a good thing.
是的，确实容易让应用崩溃，但有时候这是好事

1164
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,999
It helps you find a bug, okay?
这会帮助你找到bug

1165
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,869
Because something that you expect to be set by a certain
因为有的时候你希望他被赋予一个确定的值

1166
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:28,737
point isn't, and it crashes your app, and
如果没有，那就让应用崩溃

1167
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,206
you find it before it goes out to your customer. And some
你在app发布给你的用户之前就找到这个bug

1168
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,842
unexpected thing is happening because something's not set.
因为有些没被赋值，会发生一些预期之外的事情

1169
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,311
Now, I'm gonna show you a little later how you can
我稍后会给你们展示

1170
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,046
unwrap the optional and get the associated value
如何不让应用崩溃的情况下unwarp optional并获取关联值

1171
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:41,250
without crashing. Basically, test to see if it's set and
总的来说，自测一下它有没有被赋值

1172
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:44,286
do it, okay? So I'm gonna show you that in a little bit.
我过一会会做给你们看

1173
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:45,954
All right, so we've unwrapped this, optional.
我们已经unwarp了这个optional

1174
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:49,224
We're gonna crash if it's not set, that's fine. And so
如果没有被赋值会让应用崩溃，这没问题

1175
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:52,661
now, notice when I do the option click on digit,
注意我按住option然后点这个digit

1176
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:57,299
what's the type? String, not optional string,
什么类型呢？不是optional string

1177
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:00,569
string, that's good because we unwrapped it. So now when we
就是string，这很棒，因为我们unwarp了

1178
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:05,240
run, instead of saying touched optional 6 digit down there,
现在跑一下，就不会说touched optional 6 digit了

1179
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:10,579
it's going to say touch the 6 digit, touch 2, touch 4, 8, 9,
而是说touch the 6 digit或者2、4、8、9

1180
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:17,019
okay? Got it? Okay, now, this is going good, but we
明白了吗？这很棒

1181
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:21,123
don't really want this to be printing out in the console.
但我们不想它在控制台打印出来

1182
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,725
We want our calculator to have a display and
我们希望我们的计算器有个显示

1183
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,762
we want the digits we typed to go in the display, right. So
我们希望我们按下的digits能显示出来

1184
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,665
let's go do that. Let's add a display to our
所以现在来做这个。加一个显示

1185
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,534
user interface here. We're gonna put it at the top, okay?
到UI上。我们会把这个放在顶部

1186
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:35,537
I'm talking about this thing right up here where this 0 is.
我指的是这个右上角零的这个

1187
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,439
And I wanna it to kinda look similar to that,
我希望看起来很像这个

1188
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,241
maybe some different colors but kinda like that.
可能是不同颜色，但是类似吧

1189
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:44,479
So I'm gonna go back to my utilities area over here and
现在回到组建的区域

1190
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,547
go to the bottom. And this time,
到最底部，这次

1191
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:48,617
instead of grabbing a button, I'm gonna grab one of these,
不是抓一个button，而是抓一个这个

1192
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:52,921
a label. So a label is Read only text,
一个label，label是一个只读的文字

1193
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,691
okay? The user can't touch on it, and then type
用户不能碰这个

1194
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:58,527
with the little keyboard on the iPhone, okay? This is read
然后用键盘输入。

1195
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:01,229
only text which is what we want on my calculator. So
这是一个我们计算器上需要的只读的文字

1196
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:04,099
I'm gonna bring it over here, bring it out, again same way
我会让它到这里，拖出来

1197
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:08,503
as before. I can resize it, I can change what's in there,
跟之前一样，我可以重新定义它的大小

1198
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:11,273
I can change the font over here. Let's make this one
可以改变文字。现在让它字变大

1199
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:15,978
really big, how about 40 point. I can even make it
差不多40pt吧。我还可以让它右对齐

1200
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,747
right aligned, you know how in calculators usually
你知道一般计算器都是右对齐

1201
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:21,316
the text is on the right so there's an alignment thing for
这里有个label对齐选项

1202
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:23,952
the label here, so we'll do that. Maybe I want to change
我们可以这么做。

1203
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,189
the background color for this one too, how about blue, okay
我也想换一下背景颜色，蓝色就不错

1204
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:30,158
there's blue. I don't really like black on blue, here's
但我不喜欢蓝底黑字

1205
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,829
a color of the text, we'll go white on blue. Okay, so
这里是文字颜色，蓝底白字就挺好

1206
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:37,099
I can basically set it however I want, okay, got this UI,
我可以随意设置这些

1207
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:39,001
I could use the blue lines by the way,
也可以用蓝线辅助

1208
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:43,405
to line it up nicely here, but again not so important because
这样就可以很整齐的放置

1209
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:46,742
I'm going to do the flexible UI thing on Wednesday, but
不是特别重要的是，我会在周三教自适应的UI布局

1210
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:51,780
I could do it. All right, so now, how about connecting this
我可以做这些。

1211
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:55,050
to our controller? This is a little different because this
那么如何把这个label跟controller联系起来？

1212
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:58,220
is not a case where the user's gonna touch this thing and
这有点不太一样，因为这不是那种用户点一下

1213
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:58,887
it's gonna invoke a method.
就调用一个方法的情况

1214
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:02,524
It's more the other way around. I wanna talk to it.
这是另外一种情况，我想跟它交互

1215
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:04,359
Okay, I wanna put things in the display.
我想把东西放进去展示

1216
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,863
So this is communication coming from the controller to
这是一个从controller到显示的通信

1217
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:11,500
the display instead of from a button to the controller. So
而不是一个按钮到controller的通信

1218
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:15,771
we still connect them up in the same way using control and
我们还是一样用按住control拖拽的方式

1219
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:20,275
drag, okay, to put something into our controller. But
把一些东西放进controller

1220
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:24,179
this time instead of action up here we're going to do outlet.
但这次我们选outlet而不是action

1221
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,149
And what outlet means is instead of creating a method,
outlet的意思是新建一个熟悉

1222
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:30,285
create a property. Right? An instance variable,
而不是方法。一个实例变量

1223
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:32,721
just like currentTitle is an instance variable, or
就像currentTitle是一个实例变量

1224
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,256
property, we're gonna have a property here.
或者一个属性，这里我们有了一个属性

1225
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:36,992
And this property is going to point to this display for
这个属性会指向显示

1226
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:39,628
us so we can access it any time we want. So
这样我们就可以在任何需要的时候获取他

1227
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:44,299
I'm gonna call this property display, not that, display,
我准备叫这个属性display

1228
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,469
okay? Luckily it got the type right here, it didn't say any
碰巧这里有类型，这没说有任何对象

1229
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:50,338
objects. It's good, it knows it was a UI label. And don't
这很好，它知道是个UILabel

1230
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,974
worry about this storage, weak or strong, we'll talk about
也不用担心这个storage是strong或是weak

1231
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,043
that next week, so you can just ignore that for now.
我们下周再说，所以你现在就可以忽略他

1232
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,213
Okay, so I hit connect and it creates,
我点击connect，它就被创建了

1233
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:02,250
instead of creating a method here, it created a property.
这里创建了一个属性而不是一个方法

1234
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:06,722
Now again, this IB outlet is just something that Xcode puts,
再一次，这个IBOutlet只是Xcode放这的。

1235
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:07,989
put this little circle here. So
放了一个小圆圈在这里

1236
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:11,159
we can see what it's connected to, so you can ignore that.
我们可以看到这个链接到了什么，所以你可以忽略那个

1237
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:12,060
I told you to ignore weak and
我说了可以忽略weak和strong

1238
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,730
strong, so you can ignore that. And so hopefully
所以可以忽略它

1239
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:18,533
this is familiar to you, it looks like current title, var.
这个看起来很熟悉，有点像currentTitle

1240
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,636
This is a property on our controller. Okay,
这是你controller里的一个属性

1241
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:24,005
an instance variable, if you wanna think of it that way.
一个实例变量，如果你想这么认为的话

1242
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:29,544
It's called display. Its type is UI label exclamation point.
这叫display。类型是UILabel ！

1243
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:33,648
Okay, now what the heck is that, exclamation point? Okay,
这里的感叹号又是什么意思呢？

1244
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,784
I thought exclamation point was unwrapping optionals,
我认为感叹号是用来unwrapping optional的

1245
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:38,153
why is there an exclamation point here, it makes no sense.
这里为什么有个感叹号？这不科学。

1246
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:42,424
And in fact you can put a question mark here because
事实上你可以在这里放个问号

1247
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,860
exclamation point also means optional.
因为感叹号也代表了optional

1248
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:47,329
It means the same kinda optional as question mark.
这跟问号表示的optional是一个意思

1249
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,830
And I'm gonna leave this question mark, and
我会先在这放一个问号

1250
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,599
I'm gonna keep working on this demo, and
继续完成这个demo

1251
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:51,099
then I'm gonna go back and
然后回过头来

1252
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,167
change it to an exclamation point, and
把它改成感叹号

1253
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:55,604
show you what exclamation point means. Okay? But
告诉你们感叹号是什么意思。

1254
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:58,073
exclamation point and question mark both mean optional,
当你定义的时候，

1255
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:02,744
when you're declaring. Okay, so now I have this display.
感叹号和问号都表示optional。所以现在你有了这个display

1256
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:06,515
When numbers get touched here, I want to, basically, append
当数字被按下的时候，我想

1257
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:09,684
these digits onto whatever's already in the display,
不管显示了什么都把digit加到display上

1258
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:12,287
all right? So let's go ahead and do that.
所以现在来做这个

1259
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,556
We can get rid of this print to the console.
删掉这个打印到控制台的

1260
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,658
We don't need to do that anymore. So I'm gonna create
我们不再需要它

1261
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,294
another local variable which is also gonna be a constant,
我需要再新建一个本地变量，当然也是个常量

1262
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:24,366
so it's let. I'm gonna call it textCurrentlyInDisplay, okay?
所以是let。我叫它textCurrentlyInDisplay

1263
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:28,904
So I wanna get the text that's in this display currently. So
我想获得现在display里的字符

1264
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:33,241
I'm going to send a message to display here, right? Display.
我要在这给display发一个消息

1265
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,377
And the message, we can look it up in the documentation.
这个信息，我们可以从文档中得知

1266
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:37,913
But the message that I want to send is text. Okay?
但是我想发的消息是文字

1267
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:41,416
That gives me the text in the display. This is a UI label
这会给我display里的文字。这是个UILabel方法

1268
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:45,453
method. But this is giving me an error. Okay, and
但这里却告诉我是个错误

1269
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:48,690
the error that it's giving me here is that I haven't
这个错误说我这里没有unwarp display

1270
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,927
unwrapped display. You see that display is an optional
你看display是个optional label

1271
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:55,730
label. You can't send text to the type optional Okay, and
你不能把一个text赋给一个optional

1272
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:58,633
optional doesn't understand the message text.
optional 不理解什么是文字

1273
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:02,003
UILabel does. So, we need to get that associated value
但UILabel知道。所以我们要获得display的label的关联值

1274
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:05,207
of label, of a display, which is the UILabel, and
是一个UILabel

1275
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:07,843
we do that with the exclamation point, here.
我们会在这放一个感叹号

1276
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:10,645
And, again, notice it's offering, here, to fix it. So,
注意这里，提供了修复选项

1277
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,515
I'm gonna fix it, and i put the exclamation point in
所以我来修复他，就会放一个感叹号在这

1278
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:17,752
there. Now, this is a UILabel. It's an unwrapped,
现在这里是个UILabel，这一个unwarpped

1279
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:20,589
optional UILabel, right? This is a UILabel,
optional UILabel，对吗？这是一个UILabel

1280
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,624
and I'm sending it the message text,
我把那个文字值发给他

1281
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,626
actually text is a property, just like currentTitle
实际上text是个属性， 就像currentTitle

1282
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:29,030
is a property on button, text is a property on UILabel. And,
是一个button的属性，text是UILabel的一个属性

1283
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:33,001
in fact, if I option+click on it, you'll see var text is an
如果我按住option点它，你可以看见var text

1284
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:37,806
optional string. Why? Because UILabel might be not set.
是一个optional string。为什么？因为UILabel可能没有被赋值

1285
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:40,275
The text in it might not be set. So it also is an option,
它里面的text可能没有被赋值，所以这也是个optional

1286
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:45,647
just like currentTitle. So I need to unwrap that as well.
就像currentTitle一样，我需要同样需要unwarp

1287
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:48,950
Okay? And so now I have a string,
所以我现在有个string

1288
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:51,052
which is the string that's in there. Now you're probably
就是这里这个

1289
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,654
getting tired of these exclamation points and so
现在你可能对这个感叹号感到有点疲惫，我也是

1290
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:54,422
am I, and we're gonna be able to get rid of them.
我们将要去掉它

1291
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:56,358
Some in a second here, so not to worry.
一会就去掉，不用担心

1292
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,693
Anyway, I have this text currently in display.
不管怎样，我现在在display里拿到了这个文字

1293
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:02,697
So now I'm just gonna say that the displays, okay, and
所以现在，display

1294
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:07,002
I'm unwrapping it, text = textCurrentlyInDisplay. I'm
unwarp它 text ＝ textCurrentlyInDisplay

1295
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:11,706
just hitting tab here, okay, + the digit that was pressed.
我在这慵懒tab键，＋ digit

1296
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,809
Okay, notice that you can use + to concatenate strings.
注意你用加号来串联字符

1297
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:17,913
That's really fun. Okay, some language allow that, some not.
这很有趣，有的语言允许这么做，有的不允许

1298
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,816
So it does. Notice also that when I'm setting the value of
Swift可以。同时注意我在给optional赋值的时候

1299
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:25,120
an optional, remember text here is an optional string.
记住这里的text 是个optional string

1300
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:28,123
I can set it to be a string, and that means,
我可以把它赋值为string，这意味着

1301
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:32,294
by definition, set this optional to set and
根据定义，是赋值给optional来设定

1302
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:37,332
use this as its associated value. Right? Now,
把它赋为这个的关联变量

1303
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:41,736
how do you think I would set this optional to not be set?
那么你认为我怎么才能给这个optional 赋一个不赋值的状态？

1304
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:45,206
Anyone know? You would say,
有人知道吗？

1305
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:49,878
set this thing to be nil. This keyword means opp,
把它赋值为nill，这个关键字

1306
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,781
optional not set. So that would set this text.
表示optional 没有被赋值。所以会赋这个值

1307
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:56,051
It would blank out this text. It would set it to be not set.
这个栏里为空，这会把它赋为没有被赋值

1308
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:58,119
Okay, so an optional you can, when you're setting it,
所以一个optional，在你给它赋值的时候

1309
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:02,190
you can set it to either nil or to an associated value.
你可以把它赋为nil 或者是 关联值

1310
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,261
Okay? Sound good? So let's run.
听起来不错？让我继续

1311
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,401
All right, so hopefully when we press these buttons,
所以，理想情况下当我们按下按钮

1312
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,971
it's going to append it on to the end, here. So let's try
数字就会被加到末尾

1313
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:20,976
five, it did it. Eight, nine, although I'm not really a fan
5，它做到了，8，9，但是我不喜欢

1314
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:25,313
of a zero at the beginning there. Okay, that zero is not
前面有个0.所以

1315
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,849
really how a calculator would work. Okay, when I press that
这不是一个计算器应该有的样子。当我按五的时候

1316
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:30,452
five, I'm essentially typing a new number. It would get rid
实际上我是按了一个新数字。

1317
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:33,021
of the zero. So, we really need a way to keep track of
它应该取代0。所以需要一个方法

1318
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:35,757
whether we're in the middle of typing a number or not. Cuz if
来追踪我们是不是在输入中

1319
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:37,425
we're in the middle of typing a number,
因为如果我们在输入中

1320
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:37,926
we do the apend thing, but
那就得把数字加到尾部

1321
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:39,260
if we're not in the middle of typing a number,
如果不是

1322
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:42,163
then we just replace whatever is in that display, right? So,
那就把之前的数字替换掉，对吗？

1323
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:46,368
I'm going to add a new var, okay, a new instance variable,
我要加一个变量，实例变量

1324
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,769
a new property, called,
一个新的属性

1325
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:51,706
userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping. >> [LAUGH]
叫做userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping（笑

1326
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:52,474
>> Okay, now you laugh,
我知道你们为什么笑

1327
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,609
you laugh because that seems like a lot of typing, but
你们笑是因为这个变量名字太长了

1328
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,479
I will never have to type that again. Okay?
但我不会再做第二遍

1329
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:59,948
Because Xcode is always gonna escape complete things for
因为Xcode 总会帮我自动补全

1330
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,751
me. So, long names like that are actually good.
所以长变量名挺好的

1331
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:05,286
Okay, you wanna pick the shortest name that, you know,
你可以选一个短一点的名字

1332
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,123
it conveys what you want but you want your names,
这名字要能体现出你想要什么

1333
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:10,258
as you know in computer science naming is everything,
计算机科学里命名就是一切，你懂的

1334
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,429
you want your names to be very, very, very good for
你希望你的命名对读你代码的人

1335
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:17,432
the reader to understand what's going on, okay? Now,
非常非常非常的好理解

1336
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:20,702
this userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping is a Bool, okay?
userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping 是个Bool

1337
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:21,603
So, I'm giving you it's type,
我给它一个Bool 类型

1338
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:23,905
Bool. It's not an optional Bool. It's just a Bool. So
这不是个optional Bool，就是个Bool

1339
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:27,442
no question mark here. Okay, it's either true or false.
所以这里没有问候，这里无论true 还是false

1340
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:28,777
I'm either in the middle of typing or I'm not.
我不是在输入中或没输入

1341
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:32,313
Now as soon as I put that in there I got an error.
一旦我把这些放在这，就报错了

1342
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:34,282
See that error up there? What? That's not fair.
看到上面那个报错符合了吗？这不科学啊

1343
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:38,753
I didn't do anything up there. What is that? Let's click it.
我在上面什么都没做啊，那是什么？点一下看看

1344
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:41,456
Class ViewController has no initializers.
Class ViewController has no initializers

1345
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,725
Okay, now you're doing your homework and you're like,
这里如果你们正在做作业

1346
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,161
what the, there's nothing to do, what I just did.
你会发现，我们什么都没做

1347
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:48,496
I just typed in var here, what does that mean? Okay,
我只是刚才声明了一个变量，这是什么意思？

1348
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:51,366
well the reason you're getting that error is cuz in Swift,
你在这报错的原因是

1349
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:55,336
all properties, every single one, have to have an initial
在Swift里，所以的属性，每一个，都必须有一个初始化的值

1350
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:59,340
value. There's no, you are not allowed to have
如果你不这么做

1351
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:02,710
any properties that don't have an initial value. Okay?
就不能有一个未初始化的变量

1352
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:04,612
So how do we give this thing an initial value?
所以我们怎么给它一个初始值？

1353
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:07,715
Well, there's two ways. One, we create an initializer.
有两种方式，一种，对它进行初始化

1354
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:08,683
That's why you're getting this warning.
这就是为什么会报错

1355
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:11,486
Now I'm not gonna talk about initializers til next week. So
但下周前我不会讲怎么初始化

1356
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,822
we can't do that because I'm not gonna talk about it yet,
所以我们不能做，因为我还没讲

1357
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:16,324
okay? What's the other way that we can do it?
所以另一种是什么方式呢？

1358
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:21,729
We can just say = false. Okay, so we just initialize that,
我们直接给它赋一个false 值，我们这就对它初始化了

1359
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:24,933
and the write error goes away. Woo hoo, were winning, and
那个报错就消失了～

1360
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,067
I know some of you are saying, yeah,
我知道你们可能会说

1361
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:30,839
what about this one? Okay, you didn't initialize that. Okay,
那么这个呢？你没对它初始化啊

1362
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:33,741
that's because optionals are treated specially.
因为optional 是很特殊的

1363
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:39,047
They are always automatically initialized to not set.
他们会自动被初始化为空

1364
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:42,550
Okay? So this is basically always happening
这就是你申明一个optional 的时候会发生的

1365
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,686
when you have an optional, or var that's an optional.
或者是一个var 的optional

1366
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,287
Which makes sense, right? You have an optional.
能理解吗？你有一个optional

1367
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,589
It's not set until you set it to something.
它没有被赋值，直到你给它赋一个值

1368
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:51,960
So it starts out not set. Okay, so that's why it is set.
所以它会以没有赋值开始。这就是为什么它被赋值了

1369
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:55,630
It's set to not set. Okay? All right, so
它被赋值为没有赋值

1370
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,665
we have this thing now, we have this. Let's go ahead and
所以我们现在有了这个，继续

1371
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:00,635
use this thing we created. Actually, I'm going to do one
所有现在用我们刚刚创建的这个

1372
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:05,940
more thing here. You see this : Bool? Do we need that? No.
我还要在这多做一件事。: Bool 我们真的需要这个吗？不

1373
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:09,611
Okay, why don't we need that? Because false can only be
为什么我们不需要这个呢？

1374
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:15,750
a Bool, so Swift can infer that the type of this is Bool.
因为false 只能是个Bool 型。所以Swift 可以推倒它就是个Bool 型

1375
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:19,821
See that? Okay? All right. So, we have this
看到了吗？所以我们现在有了userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping

1376
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:23,057
userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping. We only wanna do this business
我们只想它处理

1377
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,493
right here if the user is in the middle of typing.
用户是不是正在输入中的问题

1378
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:26,995
So now we're gonna see in if statement.
所以我接下来输入

1379
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,263
If the user is in the middle of typing,
If userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping

1380
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:31,232
now again, I'm just hitting Tab here. Look Mom, no hands,
我按下Tab，这一串就输入好了。

1381
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:34,302
or one hand. If the user is in the middle of typing,
If userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping

1382
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:36,938
then we're gonna do this thing. Okay.
然后我们做这些

1383
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,742
If the user's not in the middle of typing,
如果用户不是在输入中

1384
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:43,378
then we're gonna set the displays text
那么就让display 的数字

1385
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:46,481
equal to the digit we just typed. Okay, the five, or
等于digit的数字，5，或者别的什么

1386
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:49,417
whatever, we're gonna replace what's in the display. And,
我们会替换display 里的数字

1387
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:52,921
of course, in either case, the user is definitely, no long,
当然，另一种情况，用户

1388
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:56,024
is definitely, now, in the middle of typing. Okay,
一定是在输入中

1389
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:59,561
cuz you just touched a digit, we're clearly in the middle of
因为你刚刚按了输入按钮，我们显然是在输入中

1390
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:03,097
typing. Now I'm getting pretty tired of typing display
我现在真的对没错都

1391
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:05,466
exclamation point all the time, okay?
输入display! 感到疲惫

1392
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:08,303
All the time typing display exclamation point, when in
每次都输入display! ，实际上

1393
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:12,307
fact, I know that that display is pretty much always set.
我知道display 一定是被赋值的状态

1394
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:14,776
Okay, the only time that this is not set is for
它唯一没被赋值的时间就是

1395
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:18,546
a nanosecond when this starts to come on screen,
当他一出现在屏幕上的时候

1396
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:22,650
before iOS has a chance to wire it up to this UILabel.
在iOS 系统把他变成UILabel 类型之前

1397
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:25,119
But once it's wired up, it's set forever. And
一旦他被连接上，那就永远被赋值了

1398
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:27,589
certainly by the time users are touching on digits,
而且很确定的是，当用户点在数字上时

1399
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:31,226
the UIs completely on screen, and wired up, and so I know
UI 已经在屏幕上创建好、链接好了，

1400
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:36,097
that's never going to be nil. Never, okay, in this code. So
所以我知道它用不会为空

1401
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,199
why am I forced to type display, exclamation point,
所以我为什么非要

1402
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,801
display, exclamation point, over and over, okay?
重复输入display! 呢？

1403
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:42,670
And the answer is you don't have to because we're
答案是你不需要，

1404
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:46,007
gonna go back and change this question mark to be
我们只要把一开始这个问号

1405
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,910
exclamation point. Basically if you put the exclamation
改成感叹号。总的来说，

1406
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:53,481
point where you declare it, it says that anyone can use
在你定义的时候放个感叹号，就表示所有对象都可以用这个

1407
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:57,252
this thing, and it will implicitly unwrap it, okay?
就完全的unwarp 了这个对象

1408
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:57,986
It will automatically unwrap it.
这就会自动unwarp

1409
01:10:57,988 --> 01:10:59,988
Now its still unwrapping it, so if that was nil,
现在它还是会unwarp，如果他是nil

1410
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:04,292
it will still crash, okay? But it allows me to get rid of all
它还是会让你的应用崩溃。但是它允许我

1411
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:08,529
of these exclamation points. Okay? Because it's implicit
去掉这里所有的感叹号

1412
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:10,365
that there's an exclamation point on all of them,
因为这里的感叹号完全的unwarp 了所有的对象

1413
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,200
because instead of putting a question mark here,
因为我在这放了个感叹号

1414
01:11:12,202 --> 01:11:13,468
I put the exclamation point up there.
而不是问号

1415
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,837
Everyone got that? >> [INAUDIBLE].
都懂了吗

1416
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:16,471
>> It would crash down here,
可能会在下面这里崩溃

1417
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,906
in this code down here. As soon as you access this,
这一块代码，一旦你跑到这

1418
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:21,709
if that were nil, boom, it would be unwrapping it,
如果是个nil，就会unwarp

1419
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:24,445
cuz it's implicitly unwrapped >> And again,
因为它被完全unwarp 了

1420
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,980
if I change this back to a question mark,
如果我把它改回问号

1421
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,416
now I'm gonna get all kinds of warnings down here.
现在就会出现好多警告、错误

1422
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:30,485
See errors, because I'm not unwrapping it, but
因为我没有unwarp 它

1423
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:31,719
if I put the exclamation point,
如果我在这放一个感叹号

1424
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,821
now I'm in implicitly unwrapping it everywhere.
这样我就一次性的把他在所有地方unwarp了

1425
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,658
Okay, that's called an implicitly unwrap optional.
这样就可以叫它一个完全unwarp 的optional

1426
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,694
Very important,
非常重要

1427
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:43,765
Okay, so now let's go see if that fixed everything?
我们现在看看它是不是修复了所有问题

1428
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:47,602
>> All right, so
所以

1429
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:48,536
now hopefully when we press five,
当我们按下5

1430
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:50,772
it will get rid of the zero. Five. There it is, and
就会去掉0显示5

1431
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:53,808
this is still working. Okay? So that's good. We're
我们做的很好

1432
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,778
doing great. Our keyboard is basically fully functional at
这下我们的键盘功能完全了

1433
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,147
this point. So now we want to add a,
现在要加一个操作

1434
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:02,216
an operation. Now, because of our technical thing,
因为技术上的原因

1435
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,319
we're running out of time, but I have 3 minutes left.
我们快没时间了，但还有三分钟

1436
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,021
I'm gonna add the pi button. Okay, pi is a very
我要加一个π 按钮

1437
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:10,024
simple operation. It's just gonna put pi in the display.
π 是个很简单的操作。只是放个π 在display 上

1438
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:13,461
So let's do that. I'm gonna do that by taking the 7 button
来做这个吧。我要选中7这个按钮

1439
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:14,362
and copying and pasting it.
复制粘贴它

1440
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:17,665
That's a really bad idea, as you'll see in a moment. But,
现在看来这很不好

1441
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,768
I'm just going to do that and call it pi, okay? Now,
但我就这么做了，叫它π 

1442
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,706
of course, pi is not a digit button, it's an operation, so
当然，π 不是个数字，是一个操作

1443
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:30,044
I'm going to Ctrl drag down here to create another action,
我要ctrl 拖动另外一个操作

1444
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:30,878
a different action.
一个不同的操作

1445
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,082
This action is performOperation because pi
这是个performOperation 因为π 是个操作

1446
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:36,517
is an operation. I'm gonna have all my operation buttons
我会把所有操作的按钮叫做performOperation

1447
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,721
called performOperation. And of course I'm not gonna forget
当然我不会忘了

1448
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:41,289
to change that to UI button, okay,
把它换成UIButton

1449
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:43,491
either are you on your homework, right? Okay?
你们做作业的时候也别忘了

1450
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:47,095
And here it is, so there's perform operation right there,
所以performOperation 就在这了

1451
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:50,064
okay. And perform operation, I'm gonna do the exact same
对performOperation 我要做跟

1452
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:52,734
thing that I did at the beginning of touch digit,
之前按digit 一样的事情

1453
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:55,002
which is I'm gonna ask the sender which
要问sender 

1454
01:12:55,004 --> 01:13:00,208
operation are you? So I'm gonna let mathematicalSymbol =
你是哪个操作

1455
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:05,580
the sender.currentTitle. Now of course
let mathematicalSymbol = sender.currentTitle

1456
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:09,083
I want the string so I could do the exclamation point,
我需要字符，我可以用感叹号

1457
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:13,321
okay? But if this were blank, what if I just wanted to
如果这是空的，如果我只想忽略

1458
01:13:13,323 --> 01:13:17,658
ignore that operation press? Okay, instead of crashing.
这个按下的动作呢？而不是让它崩溃

1459
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,027
Okay, what if it was legal to have that
如果让它为空是合法的

1460
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:24,165
be blank. Okay? I basically want to unwrap
我只想它被赋值的时候unwarp

1461
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:29,036
only if this is set. So the way you do that is
你做这个的方式

1462
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:32,240
you don't put the exclamation point there. Instead,
就是不要在这放个感叹号

1463
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:37,412
you put if at the beginning. And what's nice about this is
如果你在前面放个if 

1464
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:42,116
very little typing but also look how it reads, okay? If I
这很好，也看看这是怎么写的。

1465
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:47,422
can let mathematicalSymbol = sender .currentTitle, then I'm
if let mathematicalSymbol = sender.currentTitle

1466
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:50,458
gonna do something. Okay, so it reads just like English,
然后再做一些什么。读起来像是英文

1467
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,462
it's a really nice way to unwrap. So inside this if,
这个unwarp 的很好的方式

1468
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:57,064
this will be a string. It'll be the associated
在这个if 里，这会是个string

1469
01:13:57,066 --> 01:14:00,701
value of currenttype, Title. Outside of this if,
这回事currentTitle 的关联值

1470
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:01,302
it's not even defined.
if 之外，它甚至没有被定义

1471
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:04,071
mathematicalSymbol won't even be defined. Okay? Super
mathematicalSymbol 甚至没被定义

1472
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:10,011
simple. So here I can just say if mathematicalSymbol = pi,
超简单，所以我们只要let mathematicalSymbol == π

1473
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:14,782
by the way Alt + P to make pi, okay, then I can set my
按alt ＋ P 就是π ，然后设置display

1474
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:18,619
displays. I don't even need the exclamation point anymore.
我甚至不再需要感叹号

1475
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,924
Text = pi, which _pi is pi if we
Text = π，M_PI

1476
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:27,762
Alt click on this. This is a symbol. See? M under bar PI.
按alt 点它。这是个符号。M_PI

1477
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:30,865
It's a double. It's a double vision value of PI. Now,
是个double。这是个double 版的π 值

1478
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:33,301
we have an error here. Why do we have an error?
这里报错了，为什么呢？

1479
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:36,504
Because it says it cannot assign a type double to
因为不能把一个double 赋值给

1480
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:39,073
something that is a string question mark, right?
一个string？

1481
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:42,577
We know the display.text right here is a string question mark
我们知道这是个display.text 是个string？

1482
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:45,780
so we can't do that. So, how do we convert this double to
我们不能这么做，所以我们怎么把这个double

1483
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:49,317
a string? And the answer is we have to create a new string.
转换成一个string？答案是新建一个string

1484
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,886
Okay, and now you're gonna see how to create new
这样你会看到我们如何

1485
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:56,290
instances of objects in Swift, and the answer is you just put
在Swift 里新建一个实例。答案是

1486
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:59,694
the name of the class and then parentheses and then inside
打出这个类型名，然后把

1487

the parentheses you can put anything that the class
任何允许你转换的值

1488
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:06,501
will allow you to create one of itself with. Okay, and

1497
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:37,732
so here we go, this is still working and if we press Pi,
这还是好用的，当我们按下π 

1498
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:40,568
we get Pi [SOUND], we got a problem, okay?
我们得到π 值，但有个问题

1499
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,836
It's not fitting the whole Pi,

1500
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:43,971
all the digits. We can fix that really easily.
我们可以很简单的修复一下

1501
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:47,475
I'm gonna go back to here. And if we look at the inspector,

01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:09,196
We got a little pi on the end there and also look at this,
我们在最后有一个π，还有，看这个

1508
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,600
that, what a mess. So we got two problems there. For
这很不好。我们现在这里有两个问题了

1509
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:15,436
some reason when we press pi, it puts pi on the end.
因为一些原因，当我们按π，最后有个π 在末尾

1510
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:19,173
Well,why is that? Okay. That's because, let's look at
为什么呢？因为看这个

01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:22,276
this little thing. Okay. Pi is sending that, right?
π 会发送这个

1512
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:26,480
How about this one? Pi is sending that too.
这个呢？π 也会发送这个

1513
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:31,252
You see, it's sending touch digit and perform operation.
它同时响应两个方法

1514
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,754
That's because I copied and pasted the 7
因为我复制黏贴了7

1515
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:37,358
which sent touch digit and then I added this one. Okay,
所以也发送上面的这个方法

1516
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,061
now how do we fix that? You fix that by right-clicking on

1520
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,203
you can see it only has two connections here.
右击，你可以在这看到两个链接

1521
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:52,239
It's connected to touch digit and to perform operation, so

1522
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:55,509
I'm just gonna get rid of the touch digit by clicking this,
我只是需要去掉touchDigit

1523
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:57,178
gone. Now it only does perform digit,
这样就只想响应下面这个方法了

1524
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,715
or perform operation, okay. So we fixed that problem where

1525
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,149
we're just putting pi on the end, all right.
这个末尾有π 的问题

1526
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:05,453
And the other problem was that when we have the pi and

I started typing numbers,
再按数字

1528
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,922
it thought I was in the middle of typing a number and
会认为你在输入中

1529
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:11,025
it was adding them on. So that's simple, I'm just gonna
会在末尾加数字，这很简单

1530
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:14,228
say userIsInTheMiddleofTyping number = false.
userIsInTheMiddleofTyping = false

1531
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:16,364
Okay, whenever we perform an operation,
无论我什么时候操作

1532
01:17:16,366 --> 01:17:19,767
it's gonna wipe out what's in my display so I'm obviously
