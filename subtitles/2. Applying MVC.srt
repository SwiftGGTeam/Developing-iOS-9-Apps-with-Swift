[MUSIC]

00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:07,739
Stanford University. >> Okay, well, welcome

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:12,276
to Stanford CS193P. This is spring quarter of 2016, and

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:16,013
this is lecture number 2. And today, we are going to talk

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,950
about MVC, okay, I'm gonna try and really briefly cover that

6
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:23,553
because I know only about half of you know what MVC is, and

7
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:27,257
it's a very important part of doing any iOS development.

8
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,126
And then after I'm done with that, I'm gonna continue

9
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:32,795
the demo from last time, we'll use MVC and learn yet

10
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:36,565
some more things about Swift and Objective C, all right?

11
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:40,535
All right, so MVC, what is it? As I mentioned last time, it's

12
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:44,172
essentially a way of dividing up your application or

13
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:47,975
your source code into three different camps,

14
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:52,980
okay? The three camps pictured here are the model camp.

15
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:57,484
The model camp is what your application does. Okay,

16
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:58,952
nothing about how it's drawn on screen or

17
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,221
anything like that, okay. It's not how it's displayed,

18
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:03,856
it's just what it is. So for a calculator app,

19
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,926
what it is it's a calculator, so the model is probably gonna

20
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:08,827
be the part that does calculating,

21
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,930
okay. Next piece is the controller.

22
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:17,369
The controller is how your model is displayed on screen.

23
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,138
Okay, it's kind of the how. This is basically all your

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,708
UI logic, goes into your controller, all right? And

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,778
the view, you can think of as your controller's minions,

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,547
okay, the things that the controller's gonna use to put

27
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,283
things on screen. So that's buttons and labels and

28
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:36,419
tables and all those kinda things that the controller

29
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,688
needs to display what's in the model and

30
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,924
to get input from the user to update the model as well,

31
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:44,126
okay? So those are the three camps.

32
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,628
Now it's one thing to decide where things go

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,197
based on the description of the camp, but a really

34
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,333
important piece of it is the communication between camps,

35
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,435
what's allowed, what's allowed, what's not.

36
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:57,204
And when communication is allowed, how do you do it,

37
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,607
okay, in iOS? How, how is that communication facilitated?

38
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:04,944
So, to help with this, I've kind of, drew, drawn here this

39
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:08,114
little Y in the middle. It's kinda like road signs, okay?

40
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:10,916
It's like Double yellow at the bottom there is don't cross.

41
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:13,752
And then solid white is yeah, you can cross, but

42
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:17,088
you're not really supposed to generally do this without

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,358
being very careful.

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,193
the traffic is going in the same direction, so

45
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:23,627
you can pretty much crossover.

46
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,828
Probably wanna put your turn indicator on,

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,732
but off you go. Okay, so let's talk about how that works for

48
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:32,301
these three camps. First let's talk about controller talking

49
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:35,905
to the model. The controller can talk to the model all it

50
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,940
wants. It knows everything about the model.

51
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,708
It can send any message it wants to the model.

52
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,477
The controller is in complete control of the model. Okay,

53
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,679
and the controller needs that because the controller's

54
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,149
job is to present what's in the model to the user or

55
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,950
to get information from the user and update the model.

56
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,352
So it needs full control, so that's a full green arrow,

57
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:56,556
dashed white road sign, road line there can do anything at

58
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:59,992
once. Same thing on the other side, the controller obviously

59
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,795
needs to be able to use its minions however it wants to

60
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:06,265
display the model. And most of the time, the connection

61
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:09,968
between the controller and its minions is via an outlet.

62
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,104
And you remember we had an outlet on Monday, right?

63
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:13,871
It was the display?

64
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:16,007
You remember that, it was a var instance variable.

65
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:20,477
Display with an optional UI label. And that connection is

66
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,679
how the controller was talking to it's view.

67
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:25,715
That label, that UI label was part of it's view.

68
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:28,317
It was a minion in it's view. So that's

69
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,753
full green communication, kind of do whatever it wants,

70
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:32,588
controller knows everything about both sides.

71
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,191
It has to. Let's talk about the model in the view.

72
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:40,795
Those never speak to each other. Why is that? Simple,

73
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:41,963
the model is UI independent,

74
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:45,366
so there's absolutely nothing it has to say to the view,

75
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,567
which is completely UI dependent,

76
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,236
that's all the view is. The view is just the minions

77
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:52,639
of the controller. And so, you know, it makes no sense for

78
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:55,408
these two to talk to each other. So that fire, that's

79
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,911
Double yellow line, don't ever do that in this class, okay?

80
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:02,014
No communication there at all. Okay, all communication in

81
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:04,950
the model, in the view goes through the controller.

82
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,419
All right, what about from the view to the controller?

83
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,254
Can the view, like a label and stuff like that,

84
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:12,923
talk to its controller? Well, yes and

85
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,893
no. The problem with the view is all the minions

86
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:19,296
in there are generic objects like UIButton or UILabel.

87
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,297
Those were written by Apple years ago.

88
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,199
They know absolutely nothing about a calculator.

89
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,168
So there's way to kind of for them to talk to a calculator

90
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,804
and know it's a calculator. Okay, so there's limited

91
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,239
communication between the view and the controller. But

92
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,441
off course the view needs to talk to the controller because

93
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:36,177
it's the controller's minions and things happen in the U.I.

94
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,279
and need to tell the controller what's going on so.

95
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:42,516
The kind of communication we have there has to be blind and

96
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:42,549
structured.

97
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:47,087
Blind meaning the objects in the view don't know what class

98
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:47,720
they're talking to. 'Kay?

99
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,589
Cause view, buttons don't know anything about calculator view

100
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,225
controllers. And it's structured because

101
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:57,262
since there is no knowledge of the Objects on either end.

102
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,432
They have to communicate in a well-defined, pre-defined way,

103
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,301
okay. So let's talk about some of those structured ways that

104
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,737
the view minions talk to the controller. One of them

105
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,707
you learned last time is target action, okay. So

106
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,843
target action's very simple, the controller hangs a target

107
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,714
on itself by defining a method with at sign ib action on it,

108
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:18,381
usually, in Xcode, so

109
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,316
that little dot will work, okay. And

110
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:23,585
then the view when it wants to talk to the controller simply

111
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,388
calls that method and that connection. Okay.

112
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,257
The action being sent, from the view controller,

113
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,926
is wired up usually with control drag. You saw us do

114
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:35,296
that. It can be done in code. But 99% of the time we control

115
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,531
drag to create this target action connection.

116
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:40,500
So there's an example. Very simple communication between.

117
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:44,771
Menu in the View like the UI button and the Controller,

118
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:49,208
the other method. Okay? Simple one. All right, what else,

119
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,209
what other kind of communication we had

120
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:53,412
besides Target action? Well, sometimes the View needs to

121
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:56,348
communicate something a little more complicated than just

122
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,918
I was touched or something like that. Okay. For example,

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,554
it might be a school view, that's a generic view minion.

124
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:05,956
And it might need to tell the controller,

125
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,093
hey, this guy just started scrolling. Okay.

126
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:12,929
Or the person zoomed into this zoom scale. All right.

127
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,498
So let's notify the controller cuz the controller might need

128
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,834
to know that and react to that, okay.

129
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,936
Maybe it effects the model when you zoom in or out.

130
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,605
Also maybe the view like the scroll view needs to make sure

131
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,875
it's okay to do something, like if the scroll view says

132
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:29,377
should I allow vertical scrolling right now?

133
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,913
Maybe it wants to ask the controller that. So you have

134
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:35,483
a lot of messages that have words in them like should,

135
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:40,187
will, and did, okay? That the minions wanna ask

136
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,589
questions of the controller involved with controller.

137
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:46,292
Okay? So, [COUGH] This is done via what's called

138
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,795
a delegate. And we're gonna talk about delegation next

139
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,897
week. And the word delegate is appropriate here because

140
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,899
it's essentially the view's minions are delegating

141
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:57,803
some responsibility to the controller Okay. The way this

142
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:01,906
is implemented is very simple. Delegate, the delegate is just

143
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:05,243
a property in the view and that property,

144
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,778
you might ask, what's the class of that property,

145
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,616
because the view doesn't know anything about the calculator

146
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:15,852
view controller. The answer is, it's not gonna be a class.

147
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:19,055
It's going to be what's called a protocol. Okay, and

148
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:20,089
we're gonna talk about what protocols are.

149
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,491
Protocols are basically just a description of a bunch of

150
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:27,229
methods that the other guy promises to implement. Okay,

151
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,864
and so if you can imagine if the controller

152
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,299
would promise to implement these will, should, and did

153
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:33,768
things, then the viewer could talk to it even if the view

154
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,705
doesn't know what class it is. Okay, no similarly There's

155
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,741
an important aspect of MVC which is the views,

156
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:45,545
okay, the view can not own the data they are displaying. Now,

157
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,881
how are they going to display it if they don't own it?

158
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:50,650
Well, they're going to ask for it from the controller all

159
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:52,885
the time and the controller is going to get it from

160
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:56,689
the model. Okay, so that's another kind of protocol but

161
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:57,422
instead of will did and

162
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:00,525
should you've got messages in that protocol like give

163
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:03,594
me the data at this location and how many pieces of data

164
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:06,997
are there, okay? Things that are asking about the data so

165
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,366
the viewer can figure out what's going on and

166
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:13,103
display it, okay. And that's also done with delegation,

167
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:16,706
although we call that Delegate the Data Source. Okay, so

168
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,308
there'd be another property on some views called

169
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,878
the Data Source, which is this protocol based pointer,

170
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,812
basically, to another object and

171
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:27,849
the controller sets itself as that so it can get involved.

172
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,784
And providing the data for the view.

173
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:32,320
Kay? So those are the ways that the view can communicate

174
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,588
to the controller. You can see they're all pretty defined,

175
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,524
well-defined ways they're not just open ended.

176
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:40,827
Mkay? Now, this leads to a situation where

177
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:45,165
the controller's job can be described as interpreting and

178
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:49,335
formatting the model data for the view. Okay.

179
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:52,538
It also interprets view input for the model. So

180
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,939
it's an interpreter between both. That it,

181
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,942
controller job so that's really where all your UI logic

182
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:00,211
is in there. Okay, how bout the model?

183
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:02,847
Can it talk directly to the controller?

184
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:07,084
Absolutely not because the controller is

185
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:08,252
your UI logic.

186
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:11,421
The model is UI independent. So there's absolutely no way

187
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,957
the model could have anything to say to the controller.

188
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,126
However, what happens if the model,

189
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:20,830
which is UI independent, has some data that changes,

190
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:24,133
okay? So it's maybe the model is representing data on

191
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:26,435
a network. In some ways change is gonna be on the network and

192
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:29,471
it's changing. How does the model let the controller know?

193
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:33,808
Well, to do this we use what we call a radio station model,

194
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,111
okay? So the radio station is just a thing that

195
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,512
the model can set up,

196
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:39,546
set up its own radio station.

197
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,915
And it broadcasts on that radio station whenever,

198
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,883
whenever anything interesting happens. Okay,

199
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:47,987
and then the controller just tunes in to that station. So

200
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,755
the model is not really talking to the controller.

201
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,190
It's just talking to anyone who wants to know.

202
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,826
What's going on in the model. Now all that communication on

203
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,762
that rad, radio station since it's done by the model has

204
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,931
nothing to do with UI. It's about the data in the model.

205
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,701
I have new data, my data changed, those kind of

206
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:07,070
messages are going out on this radio station, okay?

207
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:11,474
Now other greater stations can be worked between other camps

208
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,942
besides the model and the controller, and

209
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,678
some have asked, hey, can I just create a view that tunes

210
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,213
into the model directly, and short circuit the controller?

211
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:20,849
And the answer is no, you don't wanna do it that way.

212
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,018
Okay? You would want to have the controller tuning in

213
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,719
to the model. And having the controller set up

214
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:26,487
this generic view thing to display the data.

215
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:28,989
Question? [INAUDIBLE] Standpoint, it's easy to

216
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,126
understand the controller view log model just like your idea

217
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:36,696
of how this things implemented in the software?

218
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:37,930
>> So the question is, so

219
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:40,666
it's easy to understand what the controller and

220
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,835
view are, they're displaying the UI.

221
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,537
The model is less easy to kinda conceptualize,

222
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,040
what that is, so what is the model? Really the model

223
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:51,976
it takes a little more design but to design the model you

224
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:56,080
have to think about what is it my app does fundamentally,

225
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:58,549
independent of how it would be displayed. Like imagine I

226
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:01,785
wanted a calculator and had a command line interface where I

227
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,420
could type five times three equals and

228
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:07,290
it would work. Okay, well that's a user interface but

229
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,458
the calculation, the actual multiplication and stuff,

230
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,428
that would be in the model. So the model is more about

231
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,363
trying to understand what it is your application does,

232
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,332
not how it's displayed. That's the separation that we have to

233
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:18,800
do in this design. >> So it's

234
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:20,167
kind of like an algorithm? >> Yeah,

235
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:23,303
it's more of the algorithms, the data, the databases and

236
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,505
stuff like that are more in the model. And you'll see it

237
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,841
by experience. we'll deal with the calculator today and

238
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:32,545
you'll get an example how that plays out. Okay.

239
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:37,249
Now, this all only builds one MVC, okay? One MVC,

240
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:42,154
generally an iOS, controls one iPhone screen or

241
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:44,923
maybe on an iPad it's two pieces or

242
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:47,859
three different pieces on the iPad screen. In other words

243
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:50,161
this is only controlling a little part of your app.

244
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:53,030
To build a real app we have to take these MVCs,

245
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:56,300
make a whole bunch of them and then combine them, okay?

246
00:11:56,302 --> 00:12:00,103
That's how we make a big app, all right? Now, when we do

247
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:03,873
that, it, it's still important that the communication is well

248
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:09,178
defined and basically the MVC, an MVC can only serve as

249
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,882
part of the view of another MVC, okay?

250
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,616
Do you see how this is arranged up here?

251
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:17,219
If you look at any of the purple controllers up there

252
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:20,221
you notice that any arrow they have to another MVC

253
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:24,225
goes out that view side, okay? So we always wanna

254
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,961
think of these MVCs as part of the view of another MVC.

255
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:30,397
And there are some MVCs like tab bar controller that's

256
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,533
an MVC that's provider iOS. Where you might have three or

257
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:37,570
four other MVCs as part of its view. And those are the things

258
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,872
when you press on the tabs at the bottom,

259
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,374
you see a different MVC, right.

260
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:45,344
So, that's what we built app at four MVCs let say,

261
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,546
one of them is the top level tab bar controller.

262
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,748
And then we have let say, three other MVCs.

263
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,850
And those three MVCs might do completely independent things

264
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:56,754
and as we build this we really want each MVC to be completely

265
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,355
self-contained, just like when we design

266
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,624
objects we want them to be completely self-contained. We

267
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,959
don't want them reaching into the internal implementations

268
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:06,295
of other objects, right? So and sometimes we're building

269
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:09,665
an object orient system here out of MVCs as well.

270
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,867
Okay, now you'll see how all this works in week three.

271
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:15,404
We'll start doing multiple MVCs and it'll all make sense.

272
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,006
Okay, one thing we don't wanna do of course is

273
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,374
build something when MVCs are [LAUGH] not working together.

274
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:21,875
If these arrows start going in every which

275
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:24,044
way direction then there's gonna be now way to understand

276
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,513
how your app works once it gets to a certain complexity.

277
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,614
It's just gonna be beyond your comprehension.

278
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:32,918
Okay, so, we don't want this. This is bad. All right,

279
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,721
so the demo I'm gonna dive right into here.

280
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:37,155
Again, this is a slide you can look at later,

281
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:39,891
important things that I'm gonna cover in this demo.

282
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,727
Cuz I'm not coming back to the slide so let me summarize,

283
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:46,764
what's coming up? On Friday, we do have this debugging,

284
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:49,667
session. It's at 1:30 in this room,

285
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:52,235
okay? I highly recommend you go to that,

286
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:54,437
especially if you've never done debugging in Xcode,

287
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:57,640
cuz you'll kinda be wondering how the heck it all works

288
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:00,910
otherwise. Next Monday we'll be talking about more Swift,

289
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:03,012
that's when your first reading assignment is due and

290
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,212
your second reading assignment will go out.

291
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:07,282
And then next Wednesday we're gonna start about talking

292
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,116
about custom drawing in iOS.

293
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:11,585
What if we wanna not just use a button and a, and a label,

294
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:14,188
but we wanna draw our own stuff? And that's when

295
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,957
programming assignment one will be due before lecture and

296
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,061
programming assignment two will go out after lecture.

297
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:22,395
Okay? Any questions,

298
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:26,899
you all ready to jump in this demo? All righty, here we go,

299
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:32,271
I'm just gonna pick up right where we left off with

300
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm gonna go to developer here as our calculator, all right.

301
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,741
I'm gonna, when I wanna relaunch it,

302
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:41,212
I could just launch and get the splash screen here. And

303
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,648
then, click on this to open it and here it is and

304
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,618
the, before, if you remember where we were, we only had

305
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,155
a pi button and then the keypad. That was great and now

306
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,624
we wanna add more buttons, and that's what we're going to do.

307
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,259
We're gonna add more operations and

308
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:59,161
more sophisticated operations, like multiplying and

309
00:14:59,163 --> 00:14:59,895
things like that.

310
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:02,731
Before I do that I wanna talk a little bit about a feature

311
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:06,368
in Swift that can really make your code read a lot better.

312
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,537
You notice here that we have this type conversion.

313
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,373
String and pi, right? Where when the pi button gets

314
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,909
pressed, we have to convert pi to a Double which is a String.

315
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:18,879
Well if I think ahead about all the operations I'm gonna

316
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:21,915
wanna add to my calculator there all Doubles,

317
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,217
everything is Doubles, not Strings, okay?

318
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,585
So am I really gonna have for all these operations,

319
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:29,054
all kinds of converting back and forth between Strings and

320
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:32,457
Doubles as I try to put the results into the display or

321
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,259
get the number out of the display?

322
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,127
That is gonna end up being really tedious,

323
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,696
okay, and it's gonna make my code kind of a mess,

324
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,330
lots of type conversions back and forth.

325
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:45,168
Wouldn't it be cool if I had a var called Display Value which

326
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,073
was a Double, and this bar automatically tracked what was

327
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,608
in that display? In other words if I ever got

328
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,177
the value of this, it would be the value of the display

329
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,746
as a Double. And if I ever set the value of this, it would

330
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,649
set the display. Wouldn't that be cool? Right, that would

331
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,951
make all the rest of my code a lot easier because I would

332
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:03,718
be all in Double land and

333
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,653
Is not having to be doing this String version?

334
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,188
And the answer is we can absolutely do that kind of

335
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,824
var, a var that tracks something else, okay? This

336
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,393
var, our user is in the middle of typing, is just stored.

337
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,828
That true false value is stored somewhere with this

338
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,265
object. This one, instead of being stored, it's going to be

339
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:23,802
calculated, okay? And we call this a computed property. And

340
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:27,072
we do it by just putting curly braces after it, okay.

341
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,006
And inside this curly braces,

342
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:29,974
we're gonna put some code to calculate

343
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:35,680
the value of this property. Both when we get it, okay. And

344
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:37,881
when we set it. So, we have this get and

345
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:41,985
set, keywords here. And inside here, we just put code to get

346
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:45,021
the value of display value. And set is the code that gets

347
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:48,624
executed when someone tries to set the value of this var.

348
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:51,927
Okay? Super simple. So, what's the implementation of this?

349
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,164
Really easy when someone tries to get the display value

350
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,734
I'm just going to return the display's text. Okay?

351
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:03,938
Unwrapped, but of course, this is a String. Right? Okay? And

352
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,307
this is supposed to be returning a Double. So,

353
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,210
I need to convert this String to a Double. So, I'm gonna say

354
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:15,416
Double. That, okay, now this is still not gonna work,

355
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:18,218
okay? Why is that? Let's look at our error. It says

356
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,087
the value of optional Double is not unwrapped. Look it's

357
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,691
trying to unwrap this. Okay, that's really weird. See it's

358
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:27,426
pointing an exclamation point at the end of this Double.

359
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:28,560
I didn't have to do that down here.

360
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:31,697
When I converted from this Double to a String, I didn't

361
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:36,134
unwrap it. Why is this? I'm trying to create a Double

362
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,168
here using this String.

363
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,037
Why do you think this is returning an optional Double

364
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,641
instead of a Double? >> Because it might not be

365
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,275
convertible. >> Correct.

366
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,878
It might not be convertible. Right? If I press hello in

367
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,951
there as the String. Double of hello, eh, I don't know. Okay,

368
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:57,086
now again it could return zero or something else but

369
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,755
really it wants to say, I don't know. I can't do it.

370
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:02,591
And the best way to do that is with an optional. So, some

371
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:05,860
constructors. Okay? Some of these initializers for various

372
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:10,431
classes can return optional versions of the thing.

373
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:13,067
In the case where they can't necessarily create one for

374
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:14,935
you. Okay? So that's really kind of awesome.

375
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:17,871
So let's go ahead and unwrap that. Okay now this would,

376
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:20,607
again, this would crash if we ever put hello in here, it's

377
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,009
gonna crash. So, we're kinda designing our codes assuming

378
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:26,679
this is always going to have a number. How about setting it?

379
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:30,115
Okay? Here we want to set the display's text

380
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:33,819
equal to what the person is setting the display value to.

381
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,755
Okay? When someone sets the display values they're

382
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,924
going to say in their code display value equals five,

383
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:44,295
right? So, how do I get the five in here, in this set?

384
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:47,498
And the answer is there's a special key word called new

385
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,635
value. Okay? This new value is going to be the Double that

386
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:56,973
somebody set. Okay? Display value equals something. Now,

387
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,841
I want to put this in display text, but, of course,

388
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:03,145
this what type is this right here? The Double, right?

389
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,047
Because they said display value equals something and

390
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,315
it's a Double. And this has got to be a String. So

391
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:11,986
I've got to convert this to a String. Just like I did below.

392
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:15,223
That, okay, can always convert a Double to a String so

393
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,324
there's no optional, stuff going on.

394
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:22,129
And that's it, okay. I've now invented a new property,

395
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:25,065
that is calculated. And every time I ask for

396
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:26,966
its value I'm gonna get what's in the display's Double.

397
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:30,169
And every time I set it, it's gonna set the display. Pretty

398
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:33,439
cool? And it makes our code like down here a lot better.

399
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:36,041
Instead of having this go down here, we're just gonna say

400
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:41,113
displayValue = Pi, okay? We don't need to do this

401
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,449
type conversion in reference displayed text, okay?

402
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,985
Everyone understand that? And, this is going to make it a lot

403
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,888
easier to add new things. Let's add another property, or

404
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,125
a another, operation here. I'm gonna add square root, okay?

405
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,159
So let's go here into square root.

406
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,395
The square root symbol I'm gonna get from the edit.

407
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:02,431
If you go into edit menu of most Mac apps you'll see this

408
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:03,999
emoji and symbols thing at the bottom,

409
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:07,569
brings up this, window or you can have a lot of emoji, but

410
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:11,840
you can also have math symbols and, down here here's square

411
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,574
root. Just the square root symbol, okay.

412
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:17,545
So I'm gonna put the square root symbol on this button.

413
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:22,883
Square root. Okay? And, then it's already wired

414
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,719
up if I hold over here you can see it's hooked up because I

415
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:29,155
copy and pasted the pi button. We can see it's okay here

416
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:31,457
because I didn't copy and paste the digit button.

417
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,159
If I right-click on it we can see that it's only gonna send

418
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:37,362
perform operation, right, so that's all good. And

419
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:40,765
all I need to do here is say if the mathematical

420
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:45,536
symbol equals, that square root thing then the display

421
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:50,741
value equals the square root of the display value.

422
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,678
Okay? So, you can see that this code is really nice.

423
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,247
If I didn't have that I would have had to get the display

424
00:20:57,249 --> 00:21:00,950
text, convert it to a Double, do the square root, convert it

425
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:03,786
back to a String, and put it back into display text.

426
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,287
See how that would have been a mess? Okay?

427
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:08,690
And, this is only just the very first one I added.

428
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:11,793
If we add a whole bunch more it's gonna be even more and

429
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:13,394
more leverage to have this thing. But

430
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,996
mostly I'm showing you this because I want you to see what

431
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:16,864
computed properties look like.

432
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,733
We use them all the time in Swift, and we're going to use

433
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:22,335
them yet again in this demo, and you should get comfortable

434
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:24,837
with the fact that not all your properties are stored

435
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,240
some of them might be computed like this. All right.

436
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:33,212
I want to add more operations now, but I have to be careful

437
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:37,182
here because this code really does not belong in my

438
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:42,220
controller, okay? Because this is the code of what my app is.

439
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:45,456
It's a calculator and I'm doing calculations here. So,

440
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,759
this needs to move into a model class.

441
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,395
Okay? So now, it's time to do MBC here and

442
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,531
move this stuff into a model class. So,

443
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:57,934
what's our model class gonna look like? Let's create it and

444
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:01,237
kinda design in an API for it and then we'll get back and

445
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:04,106
use it here. Okay? So, to create it, okay, in

446
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:07,376
fact to create any new file in x code, you're gonna go file,

447
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:10,846
new File. Okay? File, new file. And when you go here,

448
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:12,981
it's going to say, what kind of file do you want to create?

449
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:16,784
And of course, we want to create an iOS Source file.

450
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:18,819
Okay? Not watch OS or something.

451
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:21,388
And here we're going to create a Swift file. If we were

452
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,658
creating a Cocoa Touch Class, like a new view controller,

453
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,394
we would go here. But if we're going to create just a model

454
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,896
class, we go here. So I'm going to Double-click.

455
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,764
It's going to say where do you want to put this?

456
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:34,099
I'm going to put it in the same group, calculator,

457
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:36,034
that all my other swift files are in.

458
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:37,602
You see, ViewController.swift there.

459
00:22:37,604 --> 00:22:40,805
I'm going to call it calculator brain because it's

460
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,573
going to be the brain of our calculator.

461
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:45,743
It's going to be the model for our calculator.

462
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:49,546
Then click create. Here it is right here. You can see that

463
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:51,948
the very first thing, it imports Foundation,

464
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,686
not UI Kit. Never import UI Kit in a model file because

465
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:59,488
the model is UI independent. So it would never do that.

466
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,324
If you find yourself importing UI Kit, you're doing it wrong.

467
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:05,527
Okay? So, Foundation is what we want. Foundation is that

468
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,962
core services layer, kind of the basic stuff,

469
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:11,032
non-UI. Base stuff. By the way, let

470
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,401
me show you how you can put different things on each side.

471
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:15,102
So I've got calculator running over here,

472
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:17,804
what if I wanna have my controller still be over here?

473
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,639
And you do that with these things at the top. Okay?

474
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:23,343
The top line here is actually changeable. You can pick

475
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:26,679
other things to show. So, for example, I can go show my

476
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,515
controller here. Okay, now I can have them both on

477
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:32,084
screen at the same. Which is kind of convenient, especially

478
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,619
if I have a class that I'm using in another class. I can

479
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,989
see its API here, and use it over here. All right, so

480
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,157
I'm going to create a new class called Calculator Brain,

481
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,627
and we know how to do that. Right? We know how to do that.

482
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:48,131
Okay, class Calculator Brain. What's its super class?

483
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:53,002
No superclass, right? CalculatorBrain, this model,

484
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:54,136
it doesn't inherit from anything.

485
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:55,971
It doesn't need to inherit from anything, okay?

486
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:58,440
So it's just a base class. All right, now let's

487
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,942
talk about what its API is. Everyone knows the phrase

488
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:03,611
API, I hope. That means the interface through which we're

489
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,881
going to be programming, using this, CalculatorBrain.

490
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:10,017
It's all the methods and properties in it.

491
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,488
So, I'm gonna do a little function called setOperand,

492
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,191
okay, which just takes a Double, okay? That's gonna be

493
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:21,094
part of it. So if I'm using my CalculatorBrain, I'm gonna set

494
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:24,330
an operand. Then I'm gonna have another function in here,

495
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,066
called performOperation, which is gonna operate on

496
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:30,302
that operand. And the argument there is gonna be a String,

497
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:33,405
which is the mathematical symbol, okay? And then lastly,

498
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:38,242
I'm gonna have a var, which is the result of the operation,

499
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,677
which is gonna be a Double.

500
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,681
And I'm gonna do something interesting here, instead of

501
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:47,384
just having this be a public var that could be set and got.
我不会让这个公有变量同时实现 get 和 set 方法

502
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,953
Because the setting of this doesn't really make sense for
因为对于使用 CalculatorBrain 的人来说

503
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,854
anyone using my CalculatorBrain to set this.
get 方法没有什么意义

504
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:55,558
I set it internally, okay, because of performOperation.
因为 performOperation，我可以在内部 set 它

505
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,494
So I'm actually gonna make this computed and
所以我只会

506
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,229
only implement the get side of it, okay?
实现它的 get 方法

507
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,864
I'm not gonna implement this set, so
我不会实现它的 set 方法

508
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:05,833
now this becomes a read-only property. Do you, do you all
所以它现在是一个只读属性

509
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:09,637
remember another a read-only property we used last time?
还记得上一个只读属性吗？

510
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,940
Current title in button, okay? So current title in button is
button 的 currentTitle

511
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:16,476
a computed read-only property in button. That title, that
它是 button 中的一个可计算的只读属性

512
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:18,545
current title, is probably gotten from a UI label or
currentTitle 是从

513
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:21,080
something that the button is using to draw its title, okay?
button 使用来绘制它 title（也许是一个 UILabel）中的一个变量

514
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:24,150
It comes from somewhere else, that's why it's computed,
它是其它地方获取到的，所以它是一个可计算的属性

515
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:27,019
okay? So I'm gonna do the same thing here. So this is how you
我在这里也做了相同的事情

516
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:29,321
can make a property be read-only to the callers,
你们也可以使用类似的方法来把属性设置成只读的

517
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:33,692
okay? Yeah. >> So can we use the get for
[学生提问]

518
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,893
comparison, not just for assignments,
[学生提问]

519
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:37,795
like with equal equal sign? >> Okay, so
[学生提问]

520
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:40,998
the question is, is the get used for comparison?
问题是，在做比较的时候，会调用 get 方法吗？

521
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,135
Well, comparison is actually quite interesting in Swift.
Swift 中的比较还是挺有趣的

522
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:48,038
The equals equals operator is like a function, and
== 运算符像一个函数

523
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,139
it takes those two sides as arguments.
它把两边的东西当作参数

524
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:53,342
And those two sides have to implement certain methods
如果两边的东西想要被比较

525
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,843
if they wanna be comparable, okay?
就需要实现某个待定的方法

526
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,979
Now, we're not, we're not far enough along in terms of our
现在我们还没有学习的那么深

527
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:01,282
understanding of Swift to see exactly how that works. But
还没有理解到那种程度

528
00:26:01,284 --> 00:26:03,518
the answer to your question succinctly is no,
简而言之，你问题的答案是，不正确

529
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,053
the get really doesn't have anything to do with equality.
get 方法与比较（==）无关

530
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:09,590
Equality is just a function that is different,
比较是一个方法，这两者是不同的

531
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:14,594
okay? All right, so, I'm gonna return 0 for
这里先 return 0

532
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:18,832
right now, okay? Just to get rid of my little, error there.
先把这个错误提示给躲掉

533
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,934
But eventually, we're gonna have to implement this,
不过最终我们还是得实现这里

534
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:22,735
internally and make it work.
让它正确工作

535
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:26,972
Now, I wanna talk a little bit about APIs right here, okay?
我想再谈论一些有关 API 的东西

536
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:29,675
So far, every method and property we've done
到目前为止，这个类中的每个方法和属性

537
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:33,078
in this whole class has been essentially public. Meaning,
都是 public（公有） 的

538
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,447
any class can call any of the methods in any of the classes
我们类中的所有方法都可以被调用

539
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:40,484
we created. For example, all of our controller vars,
举个例子，controller 中的所有变量

540
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:44,722
okay, and functions could all be called by some other class.
还有函数，都可以被其它类调用

541
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:46,723
Now, that's bad, okay, that's bad.
这样处理不是太好

542
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:47,891
For example, displayValue,
例如 displayValue

543
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:50,760
we wouldn't want some other class setting the displayValue
我们不想让应用中的其它类通过这个 controller

544
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:53,429
in the calculators through this controller. Because we
来修改 displayValue 的值

545
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:56,832
managed that displayValue by what our model calculates,
因为我们通过 model 计算的值来管理 displayValue

546
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,067
right? So this is internal implementation.
所以这是内部的实现

547
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:01,770
In fact, all of this is internal implementation or
实际所有这些都是内部实现和控制

548
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:05,506
control. We do not want other classes to be able to call it,
我们不想让其它类调用它

549
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:09,944
unlike these three, which are external, okay? They're, they,
不像这里的三个，是外部的

550
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:12,146
we want people calling these in CalculatorBrain.
我们希望其它人的 CalculatorBrain 中调用它们

551
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,747
That's how our CalculatorBrain works.
因为 CalculatorBrain 就是这么工作的

552
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:14,481
If people couldn't call this,
如果不调用这几个方法

553
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:16,315
they couldn't even use the CalculatorBrain.
CalculatorBrain 就一点用都没有了

554
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:19,051
So how do we specify that difference between something
所以我们怎么来控制其他人

555
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:21,887
that should be called by other people or not? We do that with
能不能调用指定的方法呢？

556
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:26,091
the private keyword. So I'm gonna add private, okay,
可以通过 private（私有的）关键字

557
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:28,193
this private keyword right here,
就是这个 private

558
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:31,329
to all of my functions and methods over here.
把所有的方法都标记为 private 的

559
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:33,564
I don't, this is not really part of Swift again,
这不是 Swift 中的关键字

560
00:27:33,566 --> 00:27:34,865
this is kind of an Xcode thing, so
这是 Xcode 相关的东西

561
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,533
I put it after that. But otherwise,
所以要放到它的后面

562
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:38,568
you put it there, and we're gonna put it for all of these.
把它们都标记成 private 的

563
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,403
We're gonna make all of these be private.
它们都是

564
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:43,305
And as you program, okay, you're gonna see that one of
当你写程序的时候

565
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:45,908
the evaluation criteria on your homework is that you
你们可能会使用这种判断标准

566
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,610
properly make things private when they should be private.
当它们应该是 private 的时候，才把它们设置成 private 的

567
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:51,680
And I generally would err on the side of making it private.
我不建议使用这种策略

568
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:53,881
It's a lot easier to make something private and
我还是建议你们先把东西设置成 private 的

569
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:53,981
decide to make it public, than to use something public,
当你决定它们可以成为 private 的时候

570
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:56,083
go back later and
再调整为 public 的

571
00:27:56,085 --> 00:27:57,851
have a whole bunch of coders start using it, and
如果你反过来做，当一堆人使用你开发类的时候

572
00:27:57,853 --> 00:27:59,853
then decide, no, no, I want that to be private.
你决定把某个方法变成 private 的

573
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:02,789
Then you break all those other people. So err on the side of
那么其他人的程序就会产生问题

574
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:06,125
private first, and then making things public, okay?
所以还是先把方法设置为 private 的，需要的时候再改成 public

575
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:10,129
Now, it's actually possible to look at something and see what
现在可以通过

576
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:13,699
its public interface is by going up here to the top and
点击上方的这里，选择 Generated Interface

577
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:16,568
picking Generated Interface. This will show you the public
来看所有的公共接口

578
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,438
API of the class in the main window on the left there.
它会显示左边窗口的所有 public API

579
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,341
So we're gonna look at the public API of CalculatorBrain.
看看 CalculatorBrain 的 public API

580
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,676
You can see that it has that setOperand, performOperation,
可以看到有 setOperand, performOperation 的 reslt

581
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:28,211
and result. Notice this looks just like current title,
这个 result 看起来和 currentTitle 一样

582
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:30,914
right, where it's saying this is a read-only thing.
这表明它是一个只读的

583
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,715
We don't see any implementation here,
在这里看不到实现

584
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:35,918
this is purely the API, okay? So
只能看到 API，看不到实现

585
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,787
no implementation here. Also notice this says internal,
注意这里的 internal

586
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,490
you would think this might say public, okay? But there's
你可能会认为这里是 public

587
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:44,392
actually a slight difference between internal and public.
但是 public 和 internal 还是有点区别的

588
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:47,695
Internal means it's public within your module.
internal 代表，它只在你的 module 中是 public 的

589
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:51,565
Public would mean it's public to everyone in other modules,
public 代表它在其它的 module 中也是 public 的（全局 public）

590
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:52,199
so consider UIkit.
想想 UIKit

591
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:55,736
UIkit has hundreds of public methods that we can call.
UIKit 有许多我们可以调用的公有方法

592
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:58,271
But it also has hundreds, if not thousands of internal
但还有许多方法

593
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:01,007
methods that only other UIkit classes can call between
是只有在 UIKit 中的类才可以互相调用的

594
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,111
themselves. We don't even know what they are, okay? So, but
我们连它们是什么叫什么都不知道

595
00:29:05,113 --> 00:29:05,244
for your purposes,
但对于你来说

596
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,145
since you're always gonna be working in the module,
你的 App 就是一个 module

597
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:09,781
which is your app, internal means public,
所以 internal 就代表着 public

598
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:13,117
basically. Let's go look at our controller now, and
看一眼 controller

599
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,554
let's look at its public API, okay? So here I selected it,
看看它的 public API

600
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:19,423
look over here. And it says, there's only one public thing,
它只有一个东西是 public 的

601
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,526
userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping. I didn't mean that to be public.
userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping，我不想让它是 public 的

602
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,661
I wanted that to be private, too, I just forgot to put
我想让它变成 private 的

603
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,996
the private on there. So if I go back over here and
我只是忘加了关键字

604
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:30,966
say private, okay, then you'll see it goes away. So now we
回到这里，加上，会发现它已经不在这里了

605
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:35,204
have no public API here. Now, it's still completely usable,
现在它已经没有 public API 了，但它仍然可以使用

606
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,707
because in Interface Builder, we can wire up to this
因为在 Interface Builder 中，可以给这个 controller 连线

607
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,775
controller and make it appear in a tab bar controller,
让它出现在一个 tab bar controller 中

608
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:43,778
all those things. We can do all that without having any of
我们可以不把 internal 改成 public 

609
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,246
the internal methods here be public.
就可以实现这些

610
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:49,383
Okay, so we're gonna go back to my, oops, sorry.
返回我们的

611
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:54,588
I'll go back to my brain over here, it's got my controller
CalculatorBrain

612
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,259
over here. All right, so we've got brain and
这里放 CalculatorViewController

613
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:02,195
controller. So let's think about how we're can use this
现在来想想怎么使用这个 model

614
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:06,132
model over here, okay? We haven't implemented this yet,
我们还没有实现这个

615
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:07,700
but we've defined its public API. So
但已经完成了它的 public API

616
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:11,136
how can we use that over here? Well, we really wanna replace
所以我们怎么在这里使用呢？

617
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:14,673
all of this business with using our model, right? Cuz
把这里的业务逻辑都用 model 来完成

618
00:30:14,675 --> 00:30:18,376
this is where we were doing model things, calculations.
mode 是我们完成计算的地方

619
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:20,411
So we don't want that, okay? We wanna get rid of that, and
把这里删掉

620
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:23,113
we want to start using our model here. Well, to have
开始使用我们的 model

621
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:26,550
a model in our controller, we need to be able to talk to it,
为了在 controller 中使用 model

622
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,051
that big green arrow, okay?
需要有一个 model 的实例

623
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:32,922
So we need a private var, which I'll call brain,
所以创建一个 private 的 var，起名为 brain

624
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:36,625
which is gonna be a CalculatorBrain, okay?
它的类型是 CalculatorBrain

625
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,961
And this is the var that we're, it's gonna create our,
所以我们创建了一个

626
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,195
we're gonna create our CalculatorBrain.
CalculatorBrain 的实例

627
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:43,365
And we're gonna talk to it to do all the calculations, okay?
然后可以通过它来实现所有的计算

628
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:46,501
So this is just that big green arrow I showed you on that,
这就是我在之前幻灯片里给你们展示过的

629
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:49,804
those previous slides, where the controller talks through
大的绿色我箭头

630
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,375
this to get to the model. Now, how about creating this thing?
controller 可以通过它来调用 model

631
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:55,175
Where do we create this?
什么时候把它初始化呢？

632
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:58,011
Well, you can see that we have an error up here,
这里有一个错误

633
00:30:58,013 --> 00:30:59,645
no initializers again.
没有被初始化

634
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:00,446
That's because this var,
因为这个 var 跟其它的一样

635
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,981
like any other, has to be initialized. And
需要被初始化

636
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:06,218
I'm gonna create a CalculatorBrain here. And
我在这里创建 CalculatorBrain

637
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,389
to do that, I have to call one of its initializers. And every
调用它的初始化函数之一

638
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:15,360
time you create a new class, you get one free initializer,
每一个你新创建的类都会一个自带的初始化函数

639
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:19,897
which is an initializer that takes no arguments, okay,
就是没有参数的那个

640
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,532
kinda the basic initializer. So
最基本的初始化函数

641
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:25,268
I'm using that CalculatorBrain initializer, it came for free.
我用那个自带的初始化函数

642
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,937
I don't have anything that I need to initialize anyway.
我不需要在初始化它的时候初始化其它东西

643
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:33,109
So, that's perfectly fine, okay, so I've created it. Now,
所以这么做是没问题的

644
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:38,180
notice that this right here, do we need this?
我们需要右边的这个吗？

645
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:40,382
No, because Swift can infer that
不，因为 Swift 可以推倒出来

646
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:45,087
brain is a CalculatorBrain from that = right there, okay?
它的类型可以从右边被推倒出来

647
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:49,724
So we do not wanna put colon CalculatorBrain. All right, so
所以不用在这里放 :CalculatorBrain

648
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:53,227
now that we have this brain, kay, and it's created here, we
现在已经创建了 brain 

649
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:56,530
can use it to public API right here, to make things work.
我们就可以调用它的 public API 了

650
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:59,166
Well, one thing we know is that when the mathematical
当数学符号进到这里的时候

651
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,636
symbol comes through here, we wanna ask the brain to perform
我们想让 brain 来执行对应的操作

652
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:05,805
that operation. Okay, so we're gonna pass that mathematical
所以要把这个数学符号

653
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,241
symbol as the operation, we know that. We also
当作参数传进来

654
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:11,544
probably know that after it's done performing the operation,
当它执行完操作的时候

655
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:15,247
we probably wanna put in the display the result,
要把 result 放到 displayValue 中显示

656
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:19,818
the brain's result, this thing right here. Right? And
这里的它

657
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,620
also at the beginning of the perform operation,
在 performOperation 之前

658
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:24,789
if we're in the middle of typing a number,
如果我们正在输入数字

659
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:27,191
we better set that number at the operand for
最好把这个数字设置为 brain 的 operand

660
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:30,561
the calculator to work on it. If we go 235 square root,
如果我们计算根号 235

661
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:34,464
we got to put that 235 in as the operand for the brain.
要把 235 设置为 brain 的 operand

662
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,233
So we better say if the user is in the middle of typing
if userIsInTheMiddleOfTyping

663
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:41,804
a number then brain.set operand to be whatever's
把显示的数字设置为

664
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:45,508
in the display. You can see even here, having this display
brain.operand

665
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,378
value thing makes our code read really beautifully.
即使这里有 displayValue，代码的可读性也是非常高的

666
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,914
Okay. We can probably put this inside this if, because
可以把它放进这个 if 里

667
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:57,886
no need to set it false if it's already true. Okay, so
如果它是 已经是 false 了，就没有把它设置成 false 的必要了（这里 Paul 口误了）

668
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:01,589
that's it! That's all we need to do to hook our model up
好了，这样就把 model 和 controller 连接起来了

669
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:04,759
to our controller. Okay. And we've removed everything
把实际计算的代码都已

670
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,027
in our controller that has to do with actually calculating.
移出了 controller

671
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:12,833
We've basically given it all off to the model to do.
已经让 model 来做这件事了

672
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:14,367
So now we have to implement this, okay?
现在得实现这个

673
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,168
We've gotta implement this brain over here.
实现 brain 的逻辑

674
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,638
I'm gonna make that be the main window here.
让它占用整个窗口

675
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,172
And how are we gonna do that?
怎么实现呢？

676
00:33:20,174 --> 00:33:24,743
Well, I'm gonna have a data structure here for my brain
先创建一个变量

677
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:27,311
which makes pretty much sense, which is gonna be private,
当然要是 private 的

678
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:30,114
which is gonna be called accumulator. It's gonna be
起名为 accumulator，类型是 Double

679
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:34,318
a Double and it's going to accumulate the results, okay.
用它来存结果

680
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,521
As operations are performed, it's accumulating the result.
计算完毕后，把结果存起来

681
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:40,090
Okay, anyone who knows how calculator's built,
知道怎么实现计算器的人

682
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:43,226
it has internal calc, accumulator. So,
都应该知道它有个内部的存储器

683
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,594
this is our accumulator. Notice that I,
这就是 accumulator

684
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:47,696
as soon as I put this in here I get this error.
看这里，写完了以后，就出现了一个错误

685
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:51,233
Again, calculator brain has no initializers, that's because
同样地 calculatorBrain 没有初始化函数

686
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:54,402
I don't initialize this. So, I'm gonna say this equals 0.0.
我还没有初始化这个，把它设置为 0.0

687
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:59,874
Once I do that I do not need this because 0.0,
不过不需要这里的 Double

688
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:04,311
Swift always infers that. Or any something dot something,
因为 Swift 可以从 0.0 推倒出它是 Double 类型的

689
00:34:04,313 --> 00:34:07,548
it always infers it to be a Double, okay. So that makes
它可以推倒出来

690
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,019
this be a Double. You see? If I made this no dots just zero,
所以它就是一个 Double 类型的

691
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,888
then it's gonna infer this as an int, okay.
如果这里没有 .，Swift 就会认为它是 int 类型的

692
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:19,092
So, good thing to know there. So now that I have my
了解这一点还是不错的

693
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:22,628
accumulator, the result is always just the current state
现在已经有了 accumulator

694
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,798
of my accumulator. So that's easy, open my result. And
result 返回的一直是 accumulator 当前的值

695
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,433
same thing when someone says the operand, that kinda
如果有人调用了 setOperand

696
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:33,271
resets my accumulator to be whatever that operand is.
就会改变我 accumulator 的值

697
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,241
Okay. So those are all easy to implement. So that just leaves
实现这些很容易

698
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,844
this guy, perform operation. That's the heart of my model.
还剩下 performOperation，这是这个 model 的核心

699
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:44,014
That's the thing that's really gonna do some calculation.
它是做计算的地方

700
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:47,450
Now I could right here go back to what I was doing in my
这里可以像之前在 controller 里实现的那样

701
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,387
controller which is to have some, if there is an essence
执行一些 if else 操作

702
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,725
is here, well actually I'm gonna use switch. So
但在这里我用一下 switch

703
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,993
switch is the same as another language but
switch 和其它语言的功能类似

704
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,661
much more powerful in Swift and
但是在 Swift 中更加强大

705
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:02,764
also much more important in Swift as you will see. Okay.
你们也会看到，它在 Swift 中更重要

706
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,799
Switch It's very important thing is Swift.
switch 在 Swift 中非常重要

707
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:07,134
So, I can switch on this symbol that's legal.
我可以对这个符号做 switch 操作

708
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,637
The switch on a String. Okay. And I just put the cases that
是对 String 进行的 switch 操作

709
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,542
I wanna try. So, we have for example pi. And if pi happens,
首先把 pi 当作其中的一个 case

710
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:19,779
I wanna set my accumulator equal to pi,
把 accumulator 设置为 pi

711
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:24,017
okay. If it was for example, square root,
如果是 pi

712
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:28,354
let's go do that. My square root symbol back, here it is.
把根号调出来

713
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:31,790
So if we get square root, then I'm just gonna say that my
如果它是根号

714
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:36,461
accumulator equals the square root of the accumulator. Okay?
accumulator 就等于 根号 accumulator

715
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:40,331
So, this is basically getting us back to exactly where we
这和之前做的事情一样

716
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,067
were before but now we have a model.
只不过我们是在 model 内做

717
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:43,968
Notice we have an error here.
注意，这里有个 error

718
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,171
That's because one thing about switch, you must consider
这是由 switch 引发的

719
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:51,241
every possible value of this thing you're switching on.
你必须考虑你要 switch 东西的所有情形

720
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:55,011
Now, this is a String, so it has infinite possibilities,
它的类型是 String

721
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:59,682
okay? Now, we could spend the next few years saying case A,
我们可以花几天的时间 switch 所有的条件

722
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:02,184
no, we don't wanna do that. Instead, we're gonna put
但我们不会这么做

723
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:06,155
default break, so default means, if you can't match any
写上 default break 就可以了

724
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:10,392
of these other ones than just break out of this, okay? Now
这句话的意思是，如果一个 case 都匹配不上，就跳出这个 switch

725
00:36:10,394 --> 00:36:13,528
notice my indentations gotten a little wonky here, I'm gonna
这里的缩进有一些问题

726
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,931
teach you something fun. If you select a curly braced
教你们一个小技巧吧

727
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:20,968
region including your whole file, and hit Ctrl+I.
选中一段文件中的花括号部分

728
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,637
It'll reformat it, okay? Re-lay it out. And
输入 Ctrl+I 快捷键，这部分的缩进就会回归正确的状态

729
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,540
I strongly recommend that when you turn your homework in,
当你们在交作业之前，我强烈建议你们这么做

730
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:29,142
you select all and do Ctrl+I. Okay?
全选，然后 Ctrl+I

731
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:32,211
That way you'll be using the default indentation, even if
这样就会把代码变成默认缩进的格式

732
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:35,681
you prefer something else, use the default one because people
即使你偏好其它类型的缩进

733
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:38,017
reading your code are gonna be able to understand it better.
默认缩进会让其它人更好地理解你的代码

734
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:41,720
Okay. And believe me, you'll adjust to whatever indentaki,
相信我，你应当适应

735
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,522
indentation style this thing enforces on you, okay?
Xcode 为你调节的这种缩进方式

736
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:46,891
If you start getting, if you are a computer scientist and
如果你是一个计算机科学家

737
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:49,794
you start getting religious about things like indentation,
如果你在类似于缩进的事情上有了某些信仰

738
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:51,328
you're heading down a pretty rocky road,
那你前行的道路可能就很崎岖了

739
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,930
okay. Because when you wanna work in the real world you're
当你在真实的环境中工作

740
00:36:53,932 --> 00:36:56,966
gonna have companies that say this is the way we do it,
你的公司可能会使用你不偏好的那种缩进风格

741
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:57,033
get used to it.
并且让你适应这种风格

742
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:59,135
And if you sit there whining I don't like to do it that way,
如果你坐在那抱怨：我不想用那种风格

743
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:02,104
well, you'll probably get fired. Okay? So don't do that.
你可能会被开除的，所以还是适应吧

744
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:05,340
So here we're just gonna let the Xcode do our indentation
这里我们让 Xcode 来调整缩进

745
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:08,843
for us. So this is all we need to do right here, okay.
目前为止要做的已经完成了

746
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,812
This is full implementation. We can go back and
这是完整的实现了

747
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:13,781
run our app and it's exactly the way it was before,
运行一下 app，和以前还是一样

748
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:17,985
but now we're using a model. Okay. So
但是现在，我们有了 model

749
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:21,321
here we go, let's try 4-5, that's working square root.
试试 45，根号

750
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,090
That looks like it's working. We'll just be sure by picking
看起来代码起作用了

751
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:26,626
a number we know the square root of, pi seems to work,
根号 9 的值是 3，也没问题

752
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:28,728
square root. Okay, so we're back to where we were,
pi，根号 pi 都没问题，又回到了当时的状态

753
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,132
that's nice. Now, they'll, thing about this now is I'm
还不错

754
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:37,336
about to go add a whole bunch more operations here. And
不过还要添加好多其它的操作符在这里

755
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:42,273
if for every single one I have to do the math, do the math,
对于每一个操作符，我都要做计算

756
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:43,341
do the math each one,
每一个都要做计算

757
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:45,176
this is gonna be a lot of duplicated code
这里重复的代码会比较多

758
00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:47,978
in here. Because every time I have a unary operation like
当它是一元操作符的时候，类似于根号

759
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,281
square root, it's exactly the same. If I have cosign or
它们的操作都是相同的

760
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:53,049
square root or anything it's exactly the same.
如果这里是 cos 或者根号，这里的操作都是想同的

761
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:56,786
The only difference is these four characters. Square root,
唯一的区别是这四个字母

762
00:37:56,788 --> 00:38:00,423
or cosign or whatever. Same thing for these constants,
sqrt 还是 cos。这里的常量也是类似的

763
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,558
only this part will be different on every line,
唯一的区别是这一点地方

764
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,193
even for binary, like multiplier, whatever.
对于二元操作符也是一样的

765
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,561
It's probably only the function that does
唯一的区别是

766
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,563
the calculation that's gonna be different. So I'm gonna
进行计算的函数

767
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:12,733
factor this stuff out, so that all of these things,
所以我要重构这部分代码

768
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:17,805
like pi and square root and multiply are in a table, okay?
pi，根号，乘号之类的符号都放进一个表中

769
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:21,441
And I'm just going to have this only be doing the generic
然后在这里只需要进行通用的计算

770
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:22,742
calculations, generic constants,
通用和常量

771
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:25,611
generic numeral operations, generic binary operations.
还有通用的二元操作

772
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:28,447
And it's gonna look in the table to find out what to do.
它就会上表中查找，应该做些什么

773
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:30,115
Doesn't that seem like a much better design,
不觉得这是一种更好的设计吗？

774
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:31,483
more extensible, less code, etc? So
更少的代码，更好的扩展性

775
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:35,053
that's what were gonna do. So let's create that table, okay?
先创建这张表

776
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:37,488
And were gonna call that table operations. And
起名为 operations

777
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,524
it's going to be the class, it's actually not a class.
它的类是 Dictionary，实际上 Dictionary 不是一个类

778
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,228
Dictionary, okay, so Dictionary is a Swift thing.
它是一个 Swift 中的东西

779
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,331
It is a generic type. You're probably used to that in Java.
它是一个通用的类型，你可能在 Java 中用过

780
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,601
So you specify right here when you're declaring this
你得在这里声明它

781
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:55,038
what the keys and values are, what type? And so I want one,
key 和 value 的类型

782
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,039
I'm gonna start out just doing the constants.
先从常量开始

783
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,108
Let's have this table only do constants, okay,
先让这个表只放 pi 之类的常量

784
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,377
like pi. Okay? So I'm gonna have my keys be String.
key 的类型是 String

785
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:06,281
That'll be the name of the constant, like the pie
key 是常量的名字，例如 pi

786
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:09,350
character or whatever. And the value's gonna be a Double.
value 的类型是 Double

787
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:14,055
So that'll be like M under bar pie or whatever. Okay? So,
它就是 pi 的值 M_PI 之类的东西

788
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:16,690
I've declared it here. Now I'm actually gonna initialize
我在这里声明了它，也在这里初始化它

789
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:19,026
it because remember I have to initialize all my vars.
因为必须要初始化所有 var

790
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:21,895
You can initialize a Dictionary right on the fly
你可以在创建一个 Dictionary 的时候就初始化它

791
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:25,898
just by using the open square bracket. Notation and
使用方括号

792
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,732
you just put like for
你可以放

793
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:32,971
example pi cuz key colon m under bar pi the value.
"pi" : M_PI

794
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:36,174
Okay so I'm basically filling up the Dictionary here.
现在我是在填充这个字典

795
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:39,210
Let's do another constant how about E that's M under bar e
继续添加另一个常量，"e" : M_E

796
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:42,714
everyone know what e is 2.71 or whatever it is. Okay?
大家都知道 e 是 2.71

797
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:45,983
So, we could add a whole bunch more of these things into our
还可以向这张表中添加其它的东西

798
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,885
table. Again, we're only doing constants right now,
现在只添加常量

799
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,420
we're not doing square root and those kinds of things.
先不添加根号之类的东西

800
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,122
So, that changes my code over here.
所以这里的代码就得改了

801
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,657
Instead of having all that stuff right there,
把这些删掉

802
00:39:54,659 --> 00:40:01,364
I'm just going to let Constant equal Operations sub symbol.
换成 let constant = operation[symbol]

803
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:05,701
So,this is how you look something up in a Dictionary.
这就是从 Dictionary 中查东西的方式

804
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,603
Okay? Here's the name of the Dictionary, right here, and
这是 Dictionary 的名字

805
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:11,272
you look it up with square brackets and the thing to look
通过 [] 来查询

806
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:14,575
up. Okay? And now, I could just say my accumulator equals
然后把 constant 赋值给 constant

807
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:19,380
that constant. Okay? But, this is not gonna work. Why? Let's
但这不会有效的

808
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:24,084
find out. Error, it says, value of optional Double?
有错误，值是一个 optional 的 Double

809
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:27,120
not unwrapped. Uh-oh, it's optionals again.
还没有解包，又是 optional

810
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:30,590
Okay, what's happening here? It wants to unwrap constant.
发生了什么？

811
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:33,993
In other words, it's saying this is an optional Double.
它说这是个 optional 的 Double

812
00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:34,760
Why would the thing,
为什么会这样呢？

813
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:37,463
this Dictionary does not contain optional Doubles,
这个 Dictionary 包含的是 Double

814
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:41,033
it contains Doubles? So, why would looking this symbol up
而不是 optional Double 啊

815
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:43,068
in that Dictionary return an optional Double?
为什么从中查询数据的时候它就返回了个 optioal 了呢？

816
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,371
Anybody have an idea? Someone besides you, cuz you got it
有人有什么想法吗？

817
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,572
right before. [INAUDIBLE]. >> Yeah?
那个同学

818
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,373
>> I think their Dictionary
字典里可能没有那个 key

819
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:50,707
might not have that key? >> Correct!
正确

820
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,043
Exactly the same thing as before, okay? This Dictionary
和之前一样对吧？

821
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:57,013
might not contain that key that we're looking up. So,
Dictionary 中没有我们查询的那个 key

822
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:59,882
it's gonna return nil to say I couldn't find it.
没找到，它就会返回 nil

823
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:04,086
So, we simply need to unwrap it. Now, this is dangerous,
如果只是简单地把它 unwrap，是很危险的

824
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,221
because maybe somebody's using my API, and
如果有人调用了我的 API

825
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:08,623
they perform an operation that I don't understand,
performOperation 的参数在这里没有的话

826
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,359
now I'm gonna crash. That's not very friendly. So,
程序就会崩溃，这非常不友好

827
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:16,764
here I'm gonna use if, the if let and set my accumulator,
这里我会使用 if let

828
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:20,134
and I'm just gonna ignore any operation that I don't
如果没有的话，就直接忽略这次操作

829
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:21,968
understand. I'm not going to affect my accumulator.
我不会修改 accumulator 的值

830
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,840
Just leave it. Okay? All right, so let's run, make sure
运行一个程序，确定还有效果

831
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:33,346
this works. All right. So, the square root's not gonna work,
根号已经不好用了

832
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:35,715
cuz we don't have square roots in our table here,
因为表中没有根号

833
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:36,315
we only have constants.
只有常量

834
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:38,183
But, we have these are still working, and
这些还有效

835
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:41,219
pi is still working. Okay. So that's good. So
pi 也是，还不错

836
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:43,755
we didn't break pi, at least. And if we had an e key,
至少 pi 还有用

837
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:47,992
then the e key would work as well. All right. Now,
如果有 e 的 key 值，那它也会起作用的

838
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:52,229
we want to extend this to do square root. Okay.
现在我们来扩展，实现根号计算

839
00:41:52,231 --> 00:41:52,729
How the heck we going to do that?
应该怎么实现呢？

840
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,865
I mean, really, all we want to do is just say square roots,
我们想做的只是根号

841
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,368
whoops, I shouldn't have done that. Square roots,
不小心打错了

842
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,103
lets get our friendly neighborhood symbol for
把根号调出来

843
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:06,342
square root here. Okay? Square root we really want to
我们想把 sqrt 这个函数

844
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:08,577
put square root [LAUGH] right here.
放到这里

845
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,011
Okay? The square root function.
sqrt 这个函数

846
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:11,479
That's really what I want, what I want to do.
我就想这么做

847
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:14,849
And, like, If I had cosine I'd really want to put the cosine
如果有 cos，那我也想把 cos 函数放到这里

848
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:18,919
function here. Okay? Now this is obviously not a Double.
它显然不是一个 Double

849
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,320
[LAUGH] That's not going to work.
它不会起作用的

850
00:42:20,322 --> 00:42:24,357
So, this can't be a Double. This has to be something else.
它不是 Double，它应该是别的类型的

851
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,694
Okay? It has to be something that would work for a Double,
它应该对于 Double 和 function 类型

852
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:31,630
and would also work for a function. Okay? How are we
同时起作用

853
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,567
gonna do that? Well, we're gonna implement a new type,
该怎么做呢？我们要实现一种新的类型 enum（枚举）

854
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:41,406
okay, and it's similar to class. It's called enum. Okay?
它与 class 很相似

855
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:44,642
I'm gonna call this enum operation, and
把它起名为 Operation

856
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,445
inside this enum, I'm gonna have all the different kinds
在 enum 中，有不同的计算方式

857
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:50,214
of operations I know how to do. Now, you're probably used
你们可能在其它语言中

858
00:42:50,216 --> 00:42:52,683
to enum in other languages. What is enum in
使用过 enum

859
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:56,286
In most languages it is a discrete set of values, right?
在大多数语言中，它把集合中的值进行分类

860
00:42:56,288 --> 00:42:59,322
An enum has to have discrete values. Same thing in Swift.
Swift 中也是这样做的

861
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:02,258
It has a discrete value. So, for example, it might
它把值进行分类

862
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,262
be a constant, or maybe it's a unary operation. Or it might
它可能是常量，一元操作

863
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:10,466
be a binary operation, or many it's equals, the equal sign,
二元操作，也许是等号

864
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:12,367
which is kind of a special operation, okay.
等号是一种特殊的操作

865
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:15,970
So, enums are the same. What's different about enums in Swift
Swift 与其它语言不同的地方

866
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:20,074
is that they're like classes in that they can have methods.
是它可以像 class 一样，拥有方法

867
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:22,610
Okay? So, I can go down here and say funk,
我可以在这里

868
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:25,679
you know, something, take some arguments, return something.
定义函数，设置参数或返回值

869
00:43:25,681 --> 00:43:29,916
I can do that down here. Okay? Enums are allowed to have
在 Swift 中，enum 有函数是合法的

870
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:34,454
methods. Now, they can't have any vars. Okay? They can have
它不能有 var，但是它可以有 computed var（可计算的变量）

871
00:43:34,456 --> 00:43:37,290
computed vars, but they can't have any storage vars because
但是它不能存储变量

872
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:39,125
this is essentially their storage. Okay? The enum.
因为这些本质是它们的空间

873
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:44,363
The other thing about them is they can not have inheritance,
enum 也不能继承

874
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:46,431
so you can't have an enum that inherits
一个 enum 不能继承于另一个 enum

875
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:49,100
from another enum, which probably would be weird
这看起来很奇怪

876
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:51,903
anyway. So that is not much of a restriction. Okay?
其实这些约束也没什么的

877
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:54,372
The other thing about enums is they're pass by
enum 是通过值传递的

878
00:43:54,374 --> 00:43:57,107
value and I am just going to post while I talk about that
之后我会给你们介绍 struct

879
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:59,876
until I show you struct, which is another pass by value
它也是通过值传递的数据结构

880
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:03,513
data structure, in a moment. Okay? So, here is operation,
这是是 Operation 枚举

881
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,150
that's great. So, now I can change pi, that's an operation
现在可以把 pi 改成 Operation.Constant

882
00:44:07,152 --> 00:44:12,555
dot constant. Okay? Comment that out for a second.
先把这里注释

883
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:17,226
This is also an operation of constant. This is
这里也是 Operation.Constant

884
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:21,797
an operation dot unary operation. Okay?
Operation.UnaryOperation

885
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:26,634
And this is also an operation dot uniary operation. Okay,
这也是 Operation.UnaryOperation

886
00:44:26,636 --> 00:44:31,839
cool. So, we can now change this Double to the type
现在可以把 Double 改成 Operation 了

887
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:37,311
operation. Okay? And errors go away. These are all operations
没有错误了

888
00:44:37,313 --> 00:44:40,848
and it all works. Now, small problem here is that,
有点小问题

889
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,452
we've lost track of the actual constants and, functions, and
我们现在丢掉了真正的 constant 和 function

890
00:44:45,454 --> 00:44:49,322
we've commented them out. They're not even involved
我们把它注释起来了，它们没有参与其中

891
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:51,691
here. So, this obviously had not solved the problem.
这显然没有解决问题

892
00:44:51,693 --> 00:44:53,793
It's a step on the way to solving the problem, but
这只是解决问题中的一步

893
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:57,496
it has not solved the problem. All right, the other thing is,
问题还在

894
00:44:57,498 --> 00:45:01,767
obviously down here, looking up constants like this and
在这里，查询 constant

895
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:02,834
making the cumulative, this doesn't work,
给 accumulator 赋值，都没用了

896
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:05,636
this only works for constants, so we're not gonna do that.
它只对 constant 有效，我们就不这么做了

897
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:08,472
So, how do we look things up now for operations?
所以我们怎样查找 operatio 呢？

898
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:11,241
Well, we're gonna do a similar thing here, okay,
这里我们做件相似的事情

899
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:13,643
we're gonna say. Let, we can if,
对 operations[symbol]

900
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:17,414
if let operation equal operations sub-symbol.
进行 if let 操作

901
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:21,250
Okay? But, now this operation is going to be one of these.
但是现在这个操作，将要变成这其中之一

902
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,252
Okay? It's going to be one of these enums, right?
变成这些 enum 中的一个

903
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:23,385
If I click on it,
如果我点击它

904
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,587
you see, it's a calculator brain dot operation.
它是 CalculatorBrain.Operation 类型的

905
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:29,824
Yeah, notice also I defined this enum inside this class so
注意到，我把这个 enum 定义在了类中

906
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:33,828
its full name is calculator brain dot operation.
所以它的全称是 CalculatorBrain.Operation

907
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,196
You can nest these things.
你可以嵌套这些东西

908
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:38,132
You can even put classes inside classes if you want and
你可以在一个类中内置另一个类

909
00:45:38,134 --> 00:45:40,000
they'll just, it's just a namespace thing right?
只是命名空间的区别

910
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:44,838
The names will be whatever dot whatever dot whatever. Okay?
它的名字可能是 XXX.XXX.XXX

911
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,805
So, I've got the operation there.
所以我有了这些操作

912
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:48,507
Now, I'm going to switch on this operation, and
对它们进行 switch 操作

913
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:52,211
I know that the cases can be constant. Okay?
我知道这些 case 是常量

914
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:54,713
And, I'll just break on all these for now. So,
我先在这里加一个 break

915
00:45:54,715 --> 00:45:59,484
it could be a constant. It could be a unary operation.
它也可能是一元操作

916
00:45:59,953 --> 00:46:05,356
It could be a binary operation. Or
也可能是二元操作

917
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,559
it could be equals. Okay?
也可能是等号操作

918
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:12,029
And remembering switch I have to define every single option,
还记得我得为每一种可能的情况写 case 吗？

919
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:14,664
but I don't need default here because there are only
但这里我不需要写 default

920
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,767
four possible things that an operation could be. So,
因为这里只有四种可能

921
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:21,671
I've got a case for all of them in my switch.
我已经在 switch 中都处理了

922
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:23,305
Question? >> Two things.
有问题吗？

923
00:46:23,307 --> 00:46:26,141
Why is operation, are we not referring to the same
为什么是 operation

924
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:28,543
operation as the enum operation method?
我们为什么不用跟 enum 中相同的 Operation

925
00:46:28,545 --> 00:46:32,313
Because it's not capitalized. >> Yeah,
因为它没有大写

926
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:33,247
this operation? >> Yeah.
这个 operation?

927
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,014
>> Not capitalized makes it
因为它是一个局部变量，所以不需要大写

928
00:46:34,016 --> 00:46:36,450
a local variable, we're making it a local variable here yeah.
它是个局部变量

929
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:38,251
And, actually, that's a really good opportunity for
正好是个机会给你们讲讲

930
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,054
me to talk about how you capitalize okay?
什么时候需要大写

931
00:46:41,056 --> 00:46:45,257
All types you want to be capitalized, like Calculator,
所有的类型都要大写

932
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:47,459
Brain, Dictionary, Operation, String, Double.
Calculator, Brain, Dictionary, Operation, String, Double.

933
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:49,094
Do you notice they all are capitalized?
注意到它们都是大写了的吗？

934
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:51,663
Operate, everything, okay, is capitalized.
类型都是大写的

935
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:55,767
All local variables and vars are lowercase first letter and
局部变量第一个字母都是小写的

936
00:46:55,769 --> 00:47:00,104
then capital letter for all the subsequent words in there.
后面每一个开头的子单词开头都要大写

937
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:01,672
So it's called Camel Case, you guys know of,
这种方式叫作驼峰式命名法

938
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:05,909
have heard of that before? So, that's how you want to do
也许你们之前听说过

939
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:06,943
all your naming. If you don't do that,
你们最好都这么命名

940
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:09,479
you're going to get in trouble with me. Okay? So, I know some
但如果你不这么做，我可能就会找你麻烦了

941
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:11,947
people like to use lower case for class names, forget it.
我知道有些同学喜欢用小写命名类的名字，以后不要这么做了

942
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:13,582
You can't do it in Swift. Just don't do it, okay.
你不能在 Swift 中这么做

943
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,517
It'll be allowed, but you'll get in trouble, so
你可以不用这种方式，但你会遇到麻烦的

944
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,519
don't do it. Okay? Well,
所以不要这么做

945
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:21,155
you had a second question? >> Yeah.
还有第二个问题？

946
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:21,722
>> Why are we using the dot in
为什么在 constants 中使用 . 语法

947
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:23,991
constants? Are we referring to operation dot,
我们是在引用 Operation.xx 吗？

948
00:47:23,993 --> 00:47:26,960
okay that's my confusion. >> So, why did I say dot
这是我的问题

949
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:30,096
constant here instead of just saying constant?
为什么要在 Constant 前面加 . 呢？

950
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:33,499
And the answer is yeah, really we're doing operation dot
其实我们做的事情是 Operation.Constant

951
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:36,969
constant, but Swift can infer that it must be operation
只不过 Swift 可以推导出来它是 Operation 类型的

952
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:40,606
because it knows this is an operation. Okay?
因为它知道它就是个 Operation

953
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:47,946
Is that because it's within the operation's Dictionary?
- 是因为它在一个 Operation 的字典中吗？

954
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:48,846
>> Its part of the enum for
- 它是 Operation 中的一部分

955
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:51,615
operation, you see, operation is not really,
Operation 不......

956
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:53,584
we're not inside the Dictionary here. We pulled it
我们现在不在一个字典中

957
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:56,853
already out of the Dictionary. >> So, how does it know,
我们把它从字典中取了出来。

958
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:59,222
is it intelligent enough Oo distinguish even though you
所以它智能到可以识别出它是 Operation 类型的

959
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:00,590
computed a lower pace operation,
即使你给它取名为小写的 operation

960
00:48:00,592 --> 00:48:02,458
that it's referring to the enum with
它俩之间

961
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,325
the uppercase operation? >> Okay.
还可以建立关联吗？

962
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,828
It knows that this lowercase operation is a capital
Swift 知道这个小写的 operation 是 大写的 Operation 类型的

963
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,231
operation because I pulled it out of this Dictionary, and
是因为我把它从一个字典中取了出来

964
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:13,634
it knows that that Dictionary has operations as its value.
它知道这个字典是以 Operation 作为 value 的

965
00:48:13,636 --> 00:48:15,302
So, when I pulled out its value, it knew it.
所以当我取值出来的时候，它知道它的类型

966
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:19,907
Okay? There you go. All right. So this is all going good
懂了吧？

967
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:23,310
except for, again, we don't have the pi and the e and
代码很好，只还过我们还没有把

968
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:24,411
the square root and the cosine in here.
pi, e, 根号，cos 放进来

969
00:48:24,413 --> 00:48:26,979
So how are we gonna get those things in there? And
我们怎么才能把它们放进来呢？

970
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:29,215
the answer is, you actually already know it.
答案是，你们其实已经知道了

971
00:48:29,217 --> 00:48:34,186
You've heard it before. Associated values. Okay?
Associated values（关联值）

972
00:48:34,188 --> 00:48:37,322
Remember optional has that associated value. All
还记得 Optional 也有关联值吗？

973
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:41,226
enums have associated value. In fact, optional is an enum.
enum 也可以有，实际上 optional 就是个 enum

974
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:45,930
Okay? This is what optional looks like if you were to look
Optional 长这个样子

975
00:48:45,932 --> 00:48:51,902
at it. Enum Optional, case None, that's the nil case,
这是 nil 的情况

976
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:56,173
case Some with associated value, T. And then,
这是有值的情况

977
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:59,576
the optional is generic type. Just like Dictionary,
Optional 支持泛型，就像 Dictionary 一样

978
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:03,246
it has this generic type. So this T could be any type, and
它也有泛型，T 可以是任何类型的

979
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,782
that's how optional works. Okay?
这就是 Optional 的原理

980
00:49:05,784 --> 00:49:08,551
So, we can do the same thing down here, we could associate,
我们也可以在这里做相同的事情

981
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:12,521
for example, a Double with constants. Okay?
我们可以把 Double 和 constants 关联起来

982
00:49:12,523 --> 00:49:14,189
Because constants need a Double, M under broad pi,
因为 Constants 需要 Double

983
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:17,459
we need that thing. Okay? And so, we're doing the same thing
在这里和 Optional 做相同的事情

984
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:20,828
that optional does. Associating a value
把 Constants 关联上一个值

985
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:24,065
with our constants. So, we have this constant Double,
所以我们已经关联上了

986
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:27,067
then here, when we declare the constant we have to provide
在这里，声明的时候

987
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:29,236
the associated value which is m under bar pi.
把这个值提供出来

988
00:49:29,238 --> 00:49:32,872
Okay? Now we can get rid of our comment there.
现在可以把注释删去了

989
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:35,942
Same thing here, we can take this M under bar E, and
这也是一样

990
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:41,814
associate it with this constant, oops. Okay,
把 M_E 关联起来

991
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:44,883
see how we're doing that association? Now,
这就是关联的方式

992
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:48,453
how do we get this associated value out when we're
但是我们怎么把这个关联的值给取出来呢？

993
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:51,756
looking at a constant down here? Right, here we switched
在 switch 这里

994
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:54,959
on the operation, we know that this is a Constant, right?
我们已经知道它是一个 Constant 了

995
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:57,561
We looked it up in the operations Dictionary.
我们从字典中取到了它

996
00:49:57,563 --> 00:49:59,163
And we found that it's a constant,
发现它是一个 constant

997
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,298
let's say, like this one. How do we get it?
我们怎样获取它的值呢？

998
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,237
You do that by right here saying, let associated,
你可以在这里，通过 let

999
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,206
you know, constant, value, or whatever you want to call this
随便起一个名字

1000
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,708
is, this is just a local variable, but you can call it
它只不过是一个局部变量

1001
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:17,212
anything you want. Okay? That will make this local variable

1002
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:21,683
glom onto this associated value. okay? And

1003
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:26,388
so, now we can say accumulator equals the associated constant

1004
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,792
value. Okay? So, that's why I said switch is really

1005
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:35,596
powerful it does this kind of pattern matching to get these

1006
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:39,800
associated values out, so you do that with switch. Okay.

1007
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,469
Now, associated constant value, it's kinda yucky.

1008
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:44,838
I'm just gonna call it value. Okay. I only called it that

1009
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,306
long thing just to show you it can be called anything and

1010
00:50:47,308 --> 00:50:50,142
that it is the associated value, but you can probably

1011
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:54,980
call it value. Okay, you got that? All right. Let's run and

1012
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:58,050
see if this works. It's only going to work for constants,

1013
00:50:58,052 --> 00:51:00,819
cuz that's the only one we're, we've done any associated

1014
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:03,488
values for yet. But here we go, this is still working,

1015
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:07,692
Pi works, okay, square root, not implemented yet.

1016
00:51:07,694 --> 00:51:11,929
All right? So, let's do square root, okay? So square root,

1017
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,330
what would be the associated

1018
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:19,469
value of a unary operation? Don't be shy. What?

1019
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,241
A function yes. It's a function. Okay? So,

1020
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:29,144
how do we make a function be associated value here? Well,

1021
00:51:29,146 --> 00:51:30,912
the lucky thing is that in Swift,

1022
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:35,150
functions are types just like any other type. Okay? There's

1023
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:38,953
no differences in Swift's mind between a function type and

1024
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:42,223
a Double. Exactly the same. It can be used in all the same

1025
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:45,526
circumstances, arguments to functions, associated values,

1026
00:51:45,528 --> 00:51:49,529
local variables, anything can be of type, a function. And

1027
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:51,898
not only that, it's not a generic function,

1028
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,967
it's a function with certain arguments and return values.

1029
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,268
And how do you declare such a type?

1030
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,072
How do you say that that's a type here? You just type it.

1031
00:52:00,074 --> 00:52:04,009
So, this is a function that takes a Double and

1032
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:05,810
returns a Double. Okay?

1033
00:52:05,812 --> 00:52:08,579
That's the associated value of unary operation.

1034
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:12,516
It's a function. So, here when we want to associate a value,

1035
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:16,487
we have to put In here, just like we put a Double here for

1036
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:20,323
this one. All right? Here we have to put a function that

1037
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:24,561
takes a Double and returns a Double like, I don't know,

1038
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:30,266
square root. Okay? Or maybe,

1039
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:37,506
cosine. Okay? Everybody got that?

1040
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:38,774
Now, same thing down here.

1041
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:41,176
We got to grab that associated value.

1042
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:45,446
So, here I'm going to say let and again I can say associated

1043
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:50,017
function, but I'm just going to call this function. Okay?

1044
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:54,321
Now I have this is a local variable of type function that

1045
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:57,524
takes a Double and returns a Double. That's its type. Okay?

1046
00:52:57,526 --> 00:52:59,225
That's the type of this function. In fact, watch,

1047
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:04,964
I'll click on it. Look at it's type. It's a function that

1048
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:11,103
takes a Double and returns a Double.

1049
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:15,207
How do I use a variable like that? Accumulator.

1050
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:17,242
Oops, not accessor. Accumulator. Okay?

1051
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:21,780
Now, again this is just a local variable.

1052
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,515
I could call this foo and then I would put foo here. Okay?

1053
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:26,717
Its just a local variable. That's all it is. And

1054
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,286
it happens to be, its type is a function that takes

1055
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:32,356
a Double, returns a Double. All right. Everybody cool with

1056
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:36,760
that? All right, let's run again, see if this is working.

1057
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:44,433
All right so 81 square root, excellent. Okay?

1058
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:47,670
Executing this associated value, it looked up that

1059
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:52,240
square root, found that it was an Unary Operation with this

1060
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,710
associated value, went down here and performed operation.

1061
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:58,346
Found it here, grabbed that associated value,

1062
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:02,950
and then I used it to update my accumulator.

1063
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:03,784
Question? >> So, so

1064
00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:07,888
you just specified the types and I'm surprised that you're

1065
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,991
in, operation does not require [INAUDIBLE] because your

1066
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:15,928
Dictionary could potentially just pull anything,

1067
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,197
any kind of- >> [COUGH]

1068
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:18,564
>> We know that Dictionary can

1069
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:21,400
only have an operation in it, right. You can only have one

1070
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:25,203
of these and this only has four possible cases.

1071
00:54:25,205 --> 00:54:27,939
Even though any given case might have any associated

1072
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:30,841
value, it's still the actual case of that operation.

1073
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:32,009
There's only these four.

1074
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:33,443
So down here, when I switch on it,

1075
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:38,281
I only have to cover those four cases. No more. Okay?

1076
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:40,950
All right, what about binary operation?

1077
00:54:40,952 --> 00:54:45,121
Okay, well, binary operation, a little more complicated and

1078
00:54:45,123 --> 00:54:48,023
why is it more complicated? Because if you think about

1079
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:51,893
the way a binary operation works like multiply, 3 times

1080
00:54:51,895 --> 00:54:56,331
5 equals. Okay, when I press times I don't have enough

1081
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,634
information to update the accumulator yet. I need the 3

1082
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:02,436
and then the equals, it's only when the equals is hit that I

1083
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:05,072
have enough information to actually do it. So,

1084
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:06,106
in binary operation here,

1085
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:11,044
I'm still going to grab that binary function out of there.

1086
00:55:11,846 --> 00:55:12,011
I can't actually perform that function like I can here. So

1087
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:14,346
Okay? But,

1088
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:18,617
I'm going to have to salt away that function and the operands

1089
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:22,053
so far and wait til equals happens then I can do it.

1090
00:55:22,055 --> 00:55:24,522
Okay? But, I still need, just like unary operation,

1091
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:27,491
I need to have an associated value with a binary operation.

1092
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:32,896
What do you think that looks like? Another function,

1093
00:55:32,898 --> 00:55:38,435
right, that takes two Doubles and returns a Double. Okay?

1094
00:55:38,437 --> 00:55:39,235
Like multiply.

1095
00:55:39,237 --> 00:55:42,972
So, that's just a different kind of function. Okay?

1096
00:55:42,974 --> 00:55:45,908
And so now I can go up here and add multiply, so

1097
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:50,412
let's go ahead and get the, a, the mathematical symbol for

1098
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,948
multiply out of my emoji and symbols.

1099
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,551
Here it is right here. Multiply, okay? And

1100
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:00,755
that is an operation tha's BinaryOperation.

1101
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,924
And look it wants a function that takes two Doubles and

1102
00:56:03,926 --> 00:56:07,261
returns a Double. So I'm gonna put a function there called

1103
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:10,864
multiply, which doesn't exist in Swift, so I'm gonna have to

1104
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:14,901
go write that. By the way, we have another thing here

1105
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:19,105
which is equals, which is Operation.Equals, okay?

1106
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:22,074
So i's a kind of a special operation there,

1107
00:56:22,076 --> 00:56:25,444
okay? So, it's complaining here because multiply doesn't

1108
00:56:25,446 --> 00:56:28,780
exist, all right? So, I'm going to write multiply.

1109
00:56:28,782 --> 00:56:31,016
Here it is, I'm gonna make it a global function even,

1110
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:32,984
just like square root. Func multiply,

1111
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:35,753
okay, takes one argument that is a Double.

1112
00:56:35,755 --> 00:56:37,721
Takes another argument tha's a Double.

1113
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:42,459
Returns a Double, and it just returns op1* op2,

1114
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:45,729
okay? So I've created this new function, multiply,

1115
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:50,633
here it is, and I can now use it right here. Sound good,

1116
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:55,371
you understand that? Question? >> Why is that

1117
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:56,972
outside. >> Yeah, so

1118
00:56:56,974 --> 00:56:57,539
why did I put this outside?

1119
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,241
Because I wanted it be a function, a global function.

1120
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:04,345
Not a method in this class, okay? So I just wanted its

1121
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:07,048
scope to be wider. >> So it's more of a style?

1122
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:07,848
>> Yeah, it's kind of a style.

1123
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,850
A little more of a style thing. All right,

1124
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:14,187
so so now we have this binary operation here,

1125
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:18,057
we have to salt away the binary function like times,

1126
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:22,561
and the accumulator so far, the 5, in 5 times 3 equals,

1127
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:26,965
the 5 and the times we have to wait, salt them away. So

1128
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:29,768
I'm gonna salt them away in a data structure, and I'm,

1129
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,837
gives me a chance to teach you another data structure.

1130
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:33,237
You know class,

1131
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,041
you know enum, here's another one called struct. Okay?

1132
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:39,309
Now you know struct from other languages, of course.

1133
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:44,014
I'm gonna call this struct PendingBinaryOperationInfo,

1134
00:57:44,016 --> 00:57:47,150
okay? And it's just gonna contain these two things I

1135
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:51,187
want. One of them is the binary function that I'm going

1136
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:55,124
to do. What's the type of this? Something that

1137
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:58,794
takes two Doubles and returns a Double, that's it's type.

1138
00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:00,095
See, I'm just declaring, that is a type,

1139
00:58:00,097 --> 00:58:03,498
it's a type like any other type, like int, okay?

1140
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,000
We also need to keep track of the firstOperand for

1141
00:58:06,002 --> 00:58:09,403
this binary function, which is gonna be the accumulator so

1142
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:12,106
far. And that's gonna be of type Double, okay?

1143
00:58:12,108 --> 00:58:16,510
Now, what is a struct? Okay, we know class, we know enum,

1144
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:20,113
what's struct? Okay, struct is very much like class.

1145
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:24,050
Almost identical, okay? It can have vars, stored vars, and

1146
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:28,888
computed vars, no inheritance, okay? But the big difference

1147
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:33,625
between struct and class, is that structs, like enums,

1148
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:37,729
are passed by value, whereas classes are passed by

1149
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:41,333
reference, okay? What does that mean? All right, so

1150
00:58:41,335 --> 00:58:45,003
passing something by reference means that that thing lives in

1151
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:47,972
the heap, okay, lives in memory somewhere, and

1152
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:49,707
when you pass it around to methods or

1153
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:52,743
something like that, you're really passing a pointer

1154
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:55,345
to it. And so, when you give it to someone else, they have

1155
00:58:55,347 --> 00:58:58,147
the same one you have, because you both just have a pointer

1156
00:58:58,149 --> 00:58:59,849
to the same thing that lives in the heap.

1157
00:58:59,851 --> 00:59:02,384
That's passing by reference, okay? Hopefully you know that

1158
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:04,853
much of computer science, that that's pass by reference,

1159
00:59:04,855 --> 00:59:06,755
okay, and that's what it means in this scenario. So

1160
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:08,322
if I had a class like calculator brain,

1161
00:59:08,324 --> 00:59:10,858
and I pass that brain around, I'm talking about the same

1162
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,028
calculator brain all the time. Now I can instantiate another

1163
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:14,861
one in the heap and have a different one,

1164
00:59:14,863 --> 00:59:18,665
but, but I'm pointing, when I create one I'm pointing to it,

1165
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:21,834
and I'm passing the pointer to it around. Path by

1166
00:59:21,836 --> 00:59:26,038
value means that when you pass it, it copies it, okay?

1167
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,074
Some would think of it as it's being passed on this stack,

1168
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:30,208
the call stack of the function.

1169
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:32,577
But that's not necessarily how Swift implements it.

1170
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:35,413
But the semantics of it, are that it is copied.

1171
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:38,816
So if you have a, let's say an array, which is a struct,

1172
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:42,453
okay? A Double is a struct, it turns out. An int is a struct.

1173
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:45,188
A String is a struct. These are all structs, okay?

1174
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:48,525
And so if I passed an array to some other method, and

1175
00:59:48,527 --> 00:59:49,992
then I added something to that array,

1176
00:59:49,994 --> 00:59:53,262
it would not be added back in the caller's array. The caller

1177
00:59:53,264 --> 00:59:56,131
would have that array without that thing added, okay,

1178
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:59,368
cuz it would get a copy of it. Now you would think, whoa,

1179
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,769
this is gonna be really low performance,

1180
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:03,371
because what if I had an array of 10,000 items and

1181
01:00:03,373 --> 01:00:06,474
I passed it, it's gonna copy 10,000 things. My God,

1182
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:09,877
my code is just gonna grind to a halt. No, Swift is really

1183
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:12,646
smart about when you pass a bi-valued struct,

1184
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:15,915
it doesn't actually make a copy of it until you try and

1185
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:19,452
touch it, okay? If you try and mutate it, then it'll make

1186
01:00:19,454 --> 01:00:22,455
a copy as necessary, maybe not even a full copy, but

1187
01:00:22,457 --> 01:00:26,225
it'll mutate it. So if you're passing something and

1188
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:29,027
you don't touch it, then you are gonna be sharing it, okay?

1189
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:32,464
But, all of that is behind the scenes performance

1190
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,232
enhancement, you don't know anything about it.

1191
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:37,301
From your point of view it copies it. Structs always get

1192
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:40,871
copied, okay? Understand the difference there?

1193
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:43,173
A very important difference between structs and classes.

1194
01:00:43,175 --> 01:00:45,141
And enums are like structs. All right, so

1195
01:00:45,143 --> 01:00:49,178
I've got this right here. Now, notice that I didn't set these

1196
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,348
equal to anything, but I didn't get that warning,

1197
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:57,553
no initializers. Now usually if I put a var in a class,

1198
01:00:57,555 --> 01:00:58,587
if I don't put initial, then it says,

1199
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:01,423
no initializers, right? So, why is it not saying here?

1200
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:05,560
That's because for structs, unlike classes, classes we got

1201
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:09,230
a free initializer. What were the arguments to it? Nothing,

1202
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,865
right? Like calculator brain, parenthesis, no arguments. So,

1203
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,433
that's the free initializer you get for classes.

1204
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:16,302
For struct, the free initializer you get,

1205
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:20,940
is an initializer that, whose arguments are all of its vars,

1206
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:24,176
every one of its vars, okay? So let's go ahead and

1207
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:26,245
call that, because here in BinaryOperation,

1208
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:29,348
I need to create one. So I'm gonna create a private var

1209
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,951
here. I'm gonna call it pending. It's gonna be of type

1210
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:38,756
PendingBinaryOperationInfo, and it's gonna be an optional.

1211
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:40,691
So here I am creating my first optional.

1212
01:01:40,693 --> 01:01:45,462
It's an optional struct, okay? Why am I making this optional?

1213
01:01:45,597 --> 01:01:47,997
Because this PendingBinaryOperationInfo is

1214
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:51,234
only there if I have a pending binary operation.

1215
01:01:51,236 --> 01:01:53,502
If I haven't typed times or divide or something,

1216
01:01:53,504 --> 01:01:56,739
I don't have one of these, so I want this to be nil, okay?

1217
01:01:56,741 --> 01:02:00,375
I want this pending var that's holding this pending stuff,

1218
01:02:00,377 --> 01:02:02,677
to be nil at that point. And then when I have one,

1219
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:04,612
I'll set it to something, okay? And

1220
01:02:04,614 --> 01:02:06,714
that's exactly what I'm gonna do here in BinaryOperation,

1221
01:02:06,716 --> 01:02:11,518
I'm gonna say, pending. That's this thing right here, okay,

1222
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,520
= PendingBinaryOperationInfo.

1223
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:19,592
And when I open parentheses, look. I got a constructor for

1224
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:23,629
this PendingBinaryOperation that has these two things

1225
01:02:23,631 --> 01:02:26,432
as its two arguments. See, binaryFunction, and

1226
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:30,736
firstOperand. So now I can apply these values, this is

1227
01:02:30,738 --> 01:02:36,108
function, and the firstOperand is the accumulator. Okay, so

1228
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:40,478
now I've created one of these pending hoo-has right here,

1229
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,014
and that's all I've done. I pressed time, but

1230
01:02:43,016 --> 01:02:46,183
I'm doing 5 times 3 equals, I press the times, all I did was

1231
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:49,086
create one of these structs, and put the times and

1232
01:02:49,088 --> 01:02:52,889
the 5 in there. Now in Equals, right here,

1233
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:56,926
I'm gonna say if pending != nil. So

1234
01:02:56,928 --> 01:03:00,963
if I have a pending operation, then I'm going to evaluate it.

1235
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:04,000
So 5 times 3 equals works, but if I just say 5 equals, I

1236
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:07,903
don't have any pending times, so I'm just gonna ignore this.

1237
01:03:07,905 --> 01:03:10,172
So I'm only gonna do this if I have a pending one, and

1238
01:03:10,174 --> 01:03:14,242
what am I gonna do? Well, I'm gonna set my accumulator =,

1239
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:18,813
evaluating that pending function, which is pending!,

1240
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:22,283
because it's an optional, .binaryFunction.

1241
01:03:22,285 --> 01:03:27,921
Called with the arguments of the pending!.firstOperand, and

1242
01:03:27,923 --> 01:03:33,093
my current accumulator. Okay,

1243
01:03:33,095 --> 01:03:35,228
and now pending is nil, because I no longer,

1244
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,796
I just handled that pending thing, so

1245
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:40,266
now I no longer have a pending operation anymore.

1246
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:44,870
That make sense? Okay, so let's go take a look and

1247
01:03:44,872 --> 01:03:52,811
see if this works. All right, here we go. Let's try,

1248
01:03:52,813 --> 01:03:55,446
we don't have a times button. Let's go back to our UI and

1249
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:59,150
add a times button [LAUGH]. In fact, we'll add of our binary

1250
01:03:59,152 --> 01:04:04,054
operations here. Okay, so, I'm gonna just copy and paste.

1251
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:08,225
Put this here, paste another one. Here, we'll put all my

1252
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:13,029
binary operations across the top here, paste, okay.

1253
01:04:13,031 --> 01:04:17,300
Go here, we'll go to our emoji and symbols things.

1254
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:21,904
Here's times. We'll put divide right next to times.

1255
01:04:21,906 --> 01:04:27,443
We'll put plus right here. We'll put minus right here.

1256
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:30,145
We can put some other buttons down here too, like maybe

1257
01:04:30,147 --> 01:04:34,215
we'll put, cosine, yeah, let's put cosine in there.

1258
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:39,520
Let's cosine. Did I have another one? E I guess I had,

1259
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:44,592
right? Put E in there too. E.

1260
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:48,696
Let's also put a equal sign. Gotta have that.

1261
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:52,799
We'll put it down here. Equal sign. And here, in this empty

1262
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:55,702
space is just begging for me to put something there.

1263
01:04:55,704 --> 01:04:59,572
I'm gonna put period. Because in your homework,

1264
01:04:59,574 --> 01:05:01,540
you're gonna have to add the capability to be able to

1265
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:04,209
enter floating point numbers. So you'll need this one.

1266
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:07,779
So I'll put it there for you. Okay? All right, so here's our

1267
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:12,283
nice UI. Looks really pretty. And let's run it.

1268
01:05:16,856 --> 01:05:22,026
All right, let's try 4 x 5 =, woo hoo, it works.

1269
01:05:22,028 --> 01:05:23,660
A miracle the first time. Okay,

1270
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:24,728
let's try something a little complicated.

1271
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,563
How about this? Well, let's do some other things.

1272
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:29,065
The square root's still working, cosine, let's play pi

1273
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:33,803
cosine. That worked, cool. All right, there's E, 2.71, nice.

1274
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,538
Here's something that doesn't work though, watch this.

1275
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,874
7 x 8 x 2 x 3, uh-oh,

1276
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:43,244
this is not working. And this is not working because it's

1277
01:05:43,246 --> 01:05:46,581
requiring me to press equals to evaluate minor operations.

1278
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:51,252
So I have to go 4 x 7= x3 = x8 =, really, what I want is

1279
01:05:51,254 --> 01:05:55,823
an automatic equals anytime I press a binary operation.

1280
01:05:55,825 --> 01:06:00,927
So I can go 4 x 5, and when I go times, it doesn't equals.

1281
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:04,898
And then let me do it. So let's just do that real quick.

1282
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,202
Let's go back to our brain. I'm just gonna take this

1283
01:06:09,204 --> 01:06:11,070
little thing that equals uses and

1284
01:06:11,072 --> 01:06:15,207
make it into a function, private func, we'll call it

1285
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:20,045
executePendingBinaryOperation. It's just gonna,

1286
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:21,913
I'm just pasting in the exact same thing.

1287
01:06:21,915 --> 01:06:26,084
I'm gonna call that here, executePendingBinaryOperation.

1288
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:33,124
And I'm also gonna call it here. Okay, I personally like,

1289
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:35,359
if I have any of my cases that go onto second line,

1290
01:06:35,361 --> 01:06:37,928
I like to put them all there. I just think it looks a little

1291
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,630
nicer than having sum on the end. It doesn't really matter

1292
01:06:40,632 --> 01:06:44,600
to SWF, but I just think this looks a little nicer. Okay, so

1293
01:06:44,602 --> 01:06:47,470
we did that. So that'll fix that case.

1294
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:53,108
All right, the last two things I wanna do,

1295
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:58,747
okay let's take this 4 x 7 x 8 x 9 = okay.

1296
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:01,115
Now the last thing, two things I wanna do is one,

1297
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:05,453
I'm gonna show you how to make, divide and plus and

1298
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,922
minus work without creating a whole ton of these little

1299
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:12,626
extra functions like multiply cuz that's really gross. And

1300
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:15,161
then second, I'm gonna make our UI stretchy, so

1301
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:16,429
it works with landscape and portrait.

1302
01:07:16,431 --> 01:07:19,098
Okay, those are the two things I'm gonna do. All right,

1303
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,936
so let's go ahead and make our other four operations here,

1304
01:07:23,938 --> 01:07:25,270
which is divide, plus and minus.

1305
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:29,541
So I have to bring up our emoji again. Okay, so

1306
01:07:29,543 --> 01:07:34,412
this one will make the divide. We'll make this one be plus.

1307
01:07:34,414 --> 01:07:39,050
And we'll make this one be minus. Okay,

1308
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:42,686
now here I could have a function called divide, and

1309
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:46,323
another one called add, another one called subtract.

1310
01:07:46,325 --> 01:07:49,092
And then, I could go up here and make one of these for

1311
01:07:49,094 --> 01:07:51,127
divide, and one of these for add and one. Okay, but

1312
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:54,263
if I start doing that, what a mess. Okay, I-I've hardly even

1313
01:07:54,265 --> 01:07:56,799
gained anything by having this nice table of operations,

1314
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:58,400
if I also have to have a separate function for

1315
01:07:58,402 --> 01:08:02,404
everything I want to do. Well, SWF is gonna take care of us

1316
01:08:02,406 --> 01:08:04,939
on that front because it implements closures.

1317
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:06,340
How many people know what closures are,

1318
01:08:06,342 --> 01:08:08,842
the computer science term closures? Okay,

1319
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:12,279
hardly anybody, whoo, okay. So a closure is basically,

1320
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:15,015
you can think of it as an inline function,

1321
01:08:15,017 --> 01:08:17,483
okay? But it's an inline function that captures

1322
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:20,319
the state of it's environment. And we're gonna see why

1323
01:08:20,321 --> 01:08:21,553
that's important later in the quarter. But, for

1324
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:25,524
now, you can just focus on the inlined function part of it.

1325
01:08:25,526 --> 01:08:29,527
So, I can actually take this multiply function, okay? I'm

1326
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:32,964
just gonna select the function without the word multiply. And

1327
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:39,670
I'm gonna cut, and I'm gonna paste it right in here. Okay?

1328
01:08:39,672 --> 01:08:43,407
Now, I can't quite do that. I have to do two things. One, I

1329
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:47,911
have to take this curly brace and put it at the beginning so

1330
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:51,981
that the arguments here is inside the curly brace,

1331
01:08:51,983 --> 01:08:56,052
because the whole closure has to have curly braces beginning

1332
01:08:56,054 --> 01:08:59,021
to end. And then, since I need to separate this

1333
01:08:59,023 --> 01:09:03,325
from the rest, I also put the word in right there. Okay, so

1334
01:09:03,327 --> 01:09:04,359
that's how you make a closure.

1335
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:05,727
It's exactly the same as a function, except for

1336
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:08,596
the curly brace starts before the arguments and you put in

1337
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:13,701
after the arguments. Got that? Now, this doesn't look, so

1338
01:09:13,703 --> 01:09:15,402
that I don't need function multiply any more.

1339
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:18,138
So this doesn't look that much better. It's still kind

1340
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:23,143
of a mess. But we're gonna use type inference, yeah, to make

1341
01:09:23,145 --> 01:09:27,413
this look a lot better. Now, remember that SWF knows that

1342
01:09:27,415 --> 01:09:30,883
this binary operation takes a Double, two Doubles, and

1343
01:09:30,885 --> 01:09:36,388
returns a Double. So this is all redundant, okay?

1344
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,991
SWF can infer that that's a Double.

1345
01:09:39,993 --> 01:09:40,658
It can infer that's a Double.

1346
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:43,728
And it can infer that it re-returns a Double. So

1347
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:47,131
this is wow, all of a sudden looking a lot better already,

1348
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:51,702
okay? We can make this look all in one line. Okay,

1349
01:09:51,704 --> 01:09:55,272
that's looking pretty good. I mean, that alone is probably

1350
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:59,142
really, really good. However, it gets better than that,

1351
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:02,445
because closers also can have default arguments.

1352
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:06,682
The default argument names are $0, $1, $2,

1353
01:10:06,684 --> 01:10:09,218
$3, however many arguments it has.

1354
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,054
So you can put those as the names of the arguments

1355
01:10:12,056 --> 01:10:15,724
instead of having op one or op two whatever you

1356
01:10:15,726 --> 01:10:16,657
want to call it. Okay?

1357
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:21,028
And if you do this, then you don't even need that. Okay?

1358
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:26,200
If you use the $0 and $1, and since this is a Double, and

1359
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:29,469
SWF can infer that this return's a Double, you don't

1360
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:33,106
need return right here. >> [LAUGH]

1361
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:33,673
>> Okay?

1362
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:34,740
>> [LAUGH]

1363
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:34,973
>> So we've cleaned up our

1364
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:40,912
code quite a bit. And in fact, now divide is just this. And

1365
01:10:40,914 --> 01:10:47,118
add is just this. And subtract is just this.

1366
01:10:47,253 --> 01:10:51,055
Okay? So that's closures. Super powerful.

1367
01:10:51,057 --> 01:10:53,390
Used a lot in the iOS API. You're going to be

1368
01:10:53,392 --> 01:10:56,893
able to use it in your code to your heart's content.

1369
01:10:56,895 --> 01:11:02,799
It's very fun. Let's make sure it actually

1370
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:07,203
works. All right, 7 x 8 = all right,

1371
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:12,908
divided by 5 equals? Looks good. minus nine equals?

1372
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:17,713
All right, so all of our things here are working. Okay?

1373
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:21,483
We also could, so we can do that for

1374
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,485
our UnaryOperations as well. What if we wanted, for

1375
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:27,188
example, something like change sign. Let's go find something

1376
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:30,458
to be change sign. How about this? That's not really

1377
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,360
[LAUGH] a change sign symbol, but I'm gonna use it for that.

1378
01:11:33,362 --> 01:11:36,563
I could say change sign is Operation.constant, or

1379
01:11:36,565 --> 01:11:39,499
.UnaryOperation, sorry. UnaryOperation and

1380
01:11:39,501 --> 01:11:43,503
I need a function that takes a Double returns a Double,

1381
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:48,574
how about -$0. Okay, that changes the sign of

1382
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:53,679
the one argument. And Swift is smart enough to know that this

1383
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:58,550
has one argument. And that it is returning that argument and

1384
01:11:58,552 --> 01:12:00,752
that unary operation is Double Double, so

1385
01:12:00,754 --> 01:12:05,790
it knows that this must be a Double. It'll even infer that.

1386
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:09,326
Okay. All right, so that's it for our calculator brain.

1387
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:11,962
And if we look back at our calculator brain and

1388
01:12:11,964 --> 01:12:13,864
the code in it. All the code

1389
01:12:13,866 --> 01:12:15,532
here has nothing to do with UI.

1390
01:12:15,534 --> 01:12:19,969
It's purely about calculating and it's super-extensible.

1391
01:12:19,971 --> 01:12:22,805
If you want to add more operations here, all you need

1392
01:12:22,807 --> 01:12:26,308
to do is to provide the type of operation and

1393
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:28,110
what's specific to that operation.

1394
01:12:28,112 --> 01:12:30,845
All the calculation is done is this very simple

1395
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,881
function right here, the only complexity of which is this

1396
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:37,351
pending binary operation thing we have to do. By the way,

1397
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:41,889
this right here, this struct, should also be private. Okay,

1398
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:44,458
this struct which is calculatorBrain.PendingBinary-

1399
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,127
Info, that's its full name, that should be private as

1400
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,063
well, because we're only using that internally.

1401
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:52,398
Same thing with this operation.

1402
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:52,664
It should be private.

1403
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:55,634
Cuz we're not using it in our public API and same thing

1404
01:12:55,636 --> 01:12:59,437
with this operation, should be private. Okay, should make

1405
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:01,472
everything private that you can make private, okay?

1406
01:13:01,474 --> 01:13:04,909
Make the things public that you intend to support forever

1407
01:13:04,911 --> 01:13:09,513
in your object. Okay? So let's do that UI thing I was telling

1408
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:12,315
you about. Let's go back to our story board here, and

1409
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:14,050
we want to make this thing so that when we,

1410
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:20,490
let's see what it looks like now, actually. Okay,

1411
01:13:20,492 --> 01:13:22,224
so our UI, we know it doesn't look very good,

1412
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:24,927
this is not lined up. This is kind of nice right here but

1413
01:13:24,929 --> 01:13:27,195
it's not lined up. But what happens if we

1414
01:13:27,197 --> 01:13:29,898
rotate to landscape? The way we do that is Hardware,

1415
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:33,368
in the simulator, Hardware > Rotate Left and Right, okay?

1416
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:38,572
I'm gonna use command keys to do it. Cmd+arrow. That really

1417
01:13:38,574 --> 01:13:43,344
looks bad because I can't even say equal six times four.

1418
01:13:43,346 --> 01:13:45,312
Okay. I can't even use this UI, it's so

1419
01:13:45,314 --> 01:13:48,748
bad, okay? So, we need to fix this UI so

1420
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,784
that when it's in portrait, it's using the whole space.

1421
01:13:51,786 --> 01:13:54,653
Laying the buttons out to make it work and,

1422
01:13:54,655 --> 01:13:57,022
when it's in landscape, it's using the whole space and

1423
01:13:57,024 --> 01:13:58,557
the buttons are a different shape. Okay,

1424
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:02,060
how are we gonna do that? Well I'm gonna do that by taking

1425
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:05,697
each of these and putting them in a little stack. And then

1426
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:08,699
I'm gonna take the five stacks and stack them together.

1427
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:12,503
And then I'm gonna stack this whole thing with this, okay,

1428
01:14:12,505 --> 01:14:16,406
and create a stack of stacks. And then I'm going to bind

1429
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:19,709
the left, top, right and bottom edges of that whole

1430
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:23,046
thing to the outer edges of my UI. That way,

1431
01:14:23,048 --> 01:14:25,781
when the outer edges of my UI change, that thing will

1432
01:14:25,783 --> 01:14:27,616
change. And the stacks automatic gonna how to,

1433
01:14:27,618 --> 01:14:30,886
you know, reallocate the space. Okay, simple as that.

1434
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:33,154
So that's what we're gonna do. So let's make stacks here.

1435
01:14:33,156 --> 01:14:35,723
The way we do that, we select the things we want to stack.

1436
01:14:35,725 --> 01:14:39,460
We go to editor Embed In > Stack View. Okay, and that's

1437
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:43,263
gonna put it in a stack view here. Now, we can also go over

1438
01:14:43,265 --> 01:14:45,799
to the inspector and inspect some things about this stack

1439
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:50,036
view like I want some spacing, 10 points between each one.

1440
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:52,972
Also, you see how the cosine one is wider then the dot?

1441
01:14:52,974 --> 01:14:55,107
I don't want that, I want them all the same, so

1442
01:14:55,109 --> 01:15:00,346
I want it to distribute its space equally. Okay, so

1443
01:15:00,348 --> 01:15:01,947
now they're all equal. Okay,

1444
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:06,751
same thing here. Okay, 10 points, and

1445
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:10,321
fill equally. Now, by the way, there is no command key for

1446
01:15:10,323 --> 01:15:13,791
this, but you could go to Preferences over here,

1447
01:15:13,793 --> 01:15:16,126
Xcode > Preferences, and go to the key bindings and

1448
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:17,260
give it a command key if you wanted.

1449
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,195
If you were using stacking a lot, like I am,

1450
01:15:19,197 --> 01:15:23,166
you could do that. So let's put these in here.

1451
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:29,739
10, fill equally. This one. Oops.

1452
01:15:32,276 --> 01:15:36,812
10, fill equally, and this last one. [BLANK

1453
01:15:36,814 --> 01:15:42,884
AUDIO] All right. Now I have these five stacks right here.

1454
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:46,254
Okay, horizontal stacks. Now I'm going to take them and

1455
01:15:46,256 --> 01:15:47,822
put them in a stack. Okay? So

1456
01:15:47,824 --> 01:15:51,558
I'm going to put them in a vertical stack. [NOISE] Okay?

1457
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,029
Now, these, I want, here, to all be spread out.

1458
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,231
So right now you see the alignment is leading, so

1459
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:00,600
it's putting all these things on the leading edge?

1460
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:05,037
I want them to fill instead, so they fill the whole width.

1461
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,906
Okay? I also want spacing here, okay?

1462
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:10,942
10 between all of them, so I've got kind of a nice

1463
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:14,045
little key pad. Now let's stack this with this.

1464
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:18,449
So I'm going to select both of these and stack. Okay,

1465
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:22,086
put them in a stack together. Again, I want spacing. I want,

1466
01:16:22,088 --> 01:16:24,888
do definitely do not want fill equally here, because that

1467
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:28,325
would make this blue thing the same height as this big stack.

1468
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:31,561
So we don't want that, we just want Fill. That means they're

1469
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:35,331
gonna be their natural size, okay? [COUGH] So for this,

1470
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:38,401
it's gonna be the size that fits this text and for this,

1471
01:16:38,403 --> 01:16:39,201
it's gonna be a size for

1472
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:42,637
all those stacks to fit their contents. All right,

1473
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:46,841
now I'm gonna finally use the blue lines. Okay, because I'm

1474
01:16:46,843 --> 01:16:50,812
gonna put this thing up in the upper-left corner right here.

1475
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:53,581
Okay? And I'm gonna anchor it to that corner and

1476
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,949
here's how we do that. We use the Ctrl key,

1477
01:16:55,951 --> 01:16:58,518
just like we did when we were dragging to the code.

1478
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,287
We can also drag between elements in the UI. So,

1479
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:05,925
I'm gonna drag between this, stack thing and this

1480
01:17:05,927 --> 01:17:09,328
outer container. So, I'm just dragging up to its top edge.

1481
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:12,064
Now when I do, when I Ctrl+drag between things,

1482
01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:15,233
I can constrain them to be related in some way.

1483
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:18,203
Like I could make them be equal widths. I can make this

1484
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:20,705
thing be the same width as the container view. Or

1485
01:17:20,707 --> 01:17:25,209
I can do what I want, which is constrain the vertical spacing

1486
01:17:25,211 --> 01:17:27,478
of this to the top layout. In other words,

1487
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,514
kind of attach that to that, so I'm gonna create that.

1488
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:32,749
And you can see it creates this little I-beam,

1489
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,717
this little tiny I-beam right there. Okay,

1490
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,520
I'm gonna do the same thing to this edge, right here.

1491
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:41,523
I'm gonna attach the leading space to the container margin,

1492
01:17:41,525 --> 01:17:43,125
okay? And I can do the same thing. Now,

1493
01:17:43,127 --> 01:17:46,695
by the way, when you do this, be careful when you Ctrl+drag,

1494
01:17:46,697 --> 01:17:49,630
you wanna make sure the thing you're dragging from

1495
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:52,667
is the entire stack. Don't be,

1496
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:55,436
you know, just Ctrl+dragging from this eight or it'll

1497
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:58,238
actually pin the eight to the edge. Okay, you want to pin

1498
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,807
this whole stack view and I'm going to show you how you can

1499
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,543
select the whole stack view in a second here. Let's drag

1500
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:06,278
this over, this is going to be the trailing space.

1501
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,314
Okay. And now, here I'll show you how to, if I click on

1502
01:18:09,316 --> 01:18:12,284
this thing right here, it's selecting the two. But I want

1503
01:18:12,286 --> 01:18:15,053
to select the whole thing, so I'm going to do Ctrl+Shift.

1504
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:17,755
Ctrl+Shift, okay, see it down in the lower left there,

1505
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:20,658
Ctrl+Shift? Ctrl+Shift-click. When you do that,

1506
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,294
it says, what thing under the mouse do you want to select?

1507
01:18:24,296 --> 01:18:27,864
Do you want to select that outer container, the big stack

1508
01:18:27,866 --> 01:18:30,734
view, or this little, interior stack view? So here, I want

1509
01:18:30,736 --> 01:18:34,137
the big stack view, the one that contains the whole thing.

1510
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:37,406
All right, so and then when I Ctrl+drag, I'm being careful

1511
01:18:37,408 --> 01:18:39,474
not to Ctrl+drag from one of these buttons.

1512
01:18:39,476 --> 01:18:42,110
And here, I'm Ctrl+dragging from one the spaces there,

1513
01:18:42,112 --> 01:18:45,246
okay. So this is to vertical space into the bottom.

1514
01:18:45,248 --> 01:18:48,282
And so now I've tied them to the edges. Unfortunately,

1515
01:18:48,284 --> 01:18:52,386
I've tied these two edges too far away from the edges.

1516
01:18:52,388 --> 01:18:55,489
Okay. I wanna tie these two edges to right up next to it.

1517
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:59,325
And the way I do that is, I can do it via the Inspector

1518
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,462
right here, by clicking on this I-beam, you see.

1519
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:04,030
This constant saying how far it is.

1520
01:19:04,032 --> 01:19:06,832
I can also Double-click on this I-beam. And

1521
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,735
it puts up a little thing here. So, I don't want her

1522
01:19:09,737 --> 01:19:12,904
to be 338 points away, I want her to be either some standard

1523
01:19:12,906 --> 01:19:15,740
value, or if a standard value doesn't make sense here,

1524
01:19:15,742 --> 01:19:17,608
which it doesn't, that's why it's grayed out,

1525
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:22,413
then I'm gonna put it 0 points away. Bam. Okay?

1526
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:25,582
Same thing I can do down here. Let's Double-click this one.

1527
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:27,817
Here, a standard value is available, so

1528
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:29,318
I'm gonna click standard value. And

1529
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,655
now it's putting its standard value from the bottom. Okay.

1530
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:35,324
Now, when it's stretched there, it made these tall.

1531
01:19:35,326 --> 01:19:38,894
Okay, so that means we did something bad with our,

1532
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:41,730
you know, spacing of the things, which is,

1533
01:19:41,732 --> 01:19:45,833
what did we do wrong here? Those are all fill equally.

1534
01:19:45,835 --> 01:19:49,837
Yes. How about this guy right here? Maybe this,

1535
01:19:49,839 --> 01:19:54,008
this guy fill equally. Okay we want this internal one.

1536
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:59,012
Okay, this internal stack view, to be fill equally.

1537
01:19:59,014 --> 01:20:00,914
Glad I made that mistake, so I show you how to do that,

1538
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:04,017
okay? So, we've got this all equally spaced out. This

1539
01:20:04,019 --> 01:20:06,852
looks pretty kind of funny in a square, but I bet it's gonna

1540
01:20:06,854 --> 01:20:08,654
look pretty good in portrait and landscape,

1541
01:20:08,656 --> 01:20:17,763
let's go take a look. All right here's portrait. Hey,

1542
01:20:17,765 --> 01:20:22,067
that looks pretty darn good. 4 times 8, you know, plus 9

1543
01:20:22,069 --> 01:20:27,238
equals. Square root, okay, cosine, pi, cosine. Excellent,

1544
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:31,709
let's take a look at landscape, woohoo! It worked,

1545
01:20:31,711 --> 01:20:36,213
okay. So, very little work here. And we can make our UI

1546
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:39,349
stretchable, okay? Now, later in the quarter, we're gonna

1547
01:20:39,351 --> 01:20:41,751
have more sophisticated UIs than just these stack things,

1548
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:45,188
but we'll still be using that Ctrl+dragging to the edges.

1549
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,424
Now, your homework assignment is to reproduce everything

1550
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:49,992
I've done in these two days.

1551
01:20:49,994 --> 01:20:51,493
Add that floating point number,
